## Wave Fronts and Rays

- A wave front is the ‚Äúlocus‚Äù of all geometrically adjacent points of shared phase
    
    ![[/Untitled 22.png|Untitled 22.png]]
    
- We can consider these waves as rays instead of wave fronts s.t. when the waves travel in a homogenous isotropic material ‚Üí rays are normal to the wave front
- At a sufficient distance, they can be considered as wave fronts normal to the wave

## Reflection and Refraction

- When waves hit a non-homogenous boundary, some rays are reflected, while others are refracted through the substance
    
    ![[/Untitled 1 13.png|Untitled 1 13.png]]
    
- The incoming ray is the incident ray at an angle with respect with the normal vector to the surface and reflected at the same angle, but refracted at a different angle dependent on the index of refraction

### Diffuse and Specular Reflection

- Specular reflection is a result of a smooth surface of reflection
- Diffuse reflection is due to a rough surface that causes aa different angle of reflection than the incident

### Laws of Reflection and Refraction

- The index of refraction is $n=c/v$Ôªø e.g. for air it i close to vacuum at 1 while water is ~1.33
- The incident, reflected, and refracted rays and the normal to the surface all lie in the same ‚Äúplane of incidence‚Äù
- Law of Reflection: The angle of reflection (we consider only specular reflection in this class): $\theta_r=\theta_a$Ôªø
- Law of Refraction (Snell‚Äôs Law): with respect to the normal $n_a\sin\theta_a=n_b\sin\theta_b$Ôªø

### Three Cases of Angle

![[/Untitled 2 12.png|Untitled 2 12.png]]

- the frequency of a wave through different materials don‚Äôt change ‚Üí wavelength changes
- relative to wavelength in a vacuum ($\lambda_0$Ôªø), wavelength in the material is $\lambda = \lambda_0/n$Ôªø

### Total Internal Reflection

- Occurs when $n_b<n_a$Ôªø s.t. critical angle

$\sin\theta_{crit}=\frac{n_b}{n_a}$

### Fiber Optics

## Dispersion

- $c$Ôªø in vacuum is same for all wavelengths, but in material it depends on wavelength
- dispersion is the dependence of wave speed and index of refraction on the wavelength
    
    ![[/Untitled 4 8.png|Untitled 4 8.png]]
    
- the band of dispersed colors is a spectrum

### Rainbows

- due to reflection and refraction within water droplets
    
    ![[/Untitled 5 6.png|Untitled 5 6.png]]
    
- a secondary larger, inverted rainbow appears due to secondary reflections within the droplets

## Polarization

- transverse wavs are linearly polarized when all of their displacement is on one axis (component)
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 6.png|Untitled 7 6.png]]
    
- EM wave is linearly polarized if the electric field has only one component
    
    ![[/Untitled 8 6.png|Untitled 8 6.png]]
    
- natural light is linearly polarized in all possible transverse directions thus called unpolarized

### Malus‚Äô Law

- unpolarized light through a polarizing filter has half the intensity
- polarized light incident to a polarizing filter has intensity dependent on the angle of polarization given by Malus‚Äô law where $I_{max}$Ôªø is the intensity of the incoming polarized light

$I=I_{max}\cos^2\phi$

### Due to reflection

- can b partially or totally polarized due to reflection e.g. at one angle called the polarizing angle light for which the electric field lies in the plane of incidence is not reflected but completely refracted
- when the angle of incidence = polarizing angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular
    
    ![[/Untitled 9 5.png|Untitled 9 5.png]]
    

$n_a\sin\theta_p=n_b\sin(90¬∫-\theta_p)=n_b\cos\theta$

- the relationship of polarizing angle to indices of refraction is Brewster‚Äôs Law

$\tan\theta_p=\frac{n_b}{n_a}$

### Circular Polarization

- occurs when the electric field vector has const. magnitude but rotates around direction of propagation
- when the wav propagates out of the page (towards you) the E vector rotates clockwise and is called a right circularly polarized EM wave and v.v.
- this occurs when the components of E field are not in phase, e.g.

$\vec E(x,t)=E_{max}\cos(kx-\omega t)\hat j\space+\space E_{max}\sin(kx-\omega t)\hat k\\\space\\$

## Scattering

- sunlight hitting the surface of earth has been scattered across the sky due to absorption and re-radiation by the atmosphere ‚Üí explains why sky is blue
- Rayleigh scattering is when the unpolarized light oscillates molecules in the atmosphere which produces polarized light perpendicular to the motion of the charges

$I\propto\frac{1}{\lambda^4}$

i.e. shorter wavelengths dominate
