# Big Ideas

## Superposition

- overlapping of waves in space â†’ total wave at any moment is given by principle of superposition
- Can be determined by considering each individual waves expected state at point of interference in the environment of no interference then superimposing each wave moment onto each other (usually linear sum)
- Two wave fronts made by sources in phase (vibrate in unison) and coherent (two monochromatic sources of same frequency and constant phase relationship - not necessarily in phase)
    
    ![[/Untitled 1 44.png|Untitled 1 44.png]]
    
- at a point equidistant to sources in phase will result in a wave with twice the amplitude (perfectly constructive interference)

### Constructive Interference

$r_2-r_1=m\lambda\quad m\in \Z$

### Destructive Interference

$r_2-r_1=\bigg(m+\frac12\bigg)\lambda\quad m\in\Z$

### Nodal Curves

- the anti-nodal curve covers each constructive interference for a particular $m$ï»¿

## Double Slit Interference

- an early experiment of two-source interference of light
    
    ![[/Untitled 5 26.png|Untitled 5 26.png]]
    
- we make the assumption: distance from slits to screen $R>> d$ï»¿ the distance between the slit s.t. rays are now parallel and difference in path length is \
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 25.png|Untitled 6 25.png]]
    
- interference causes bright and dark bands given by
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 24.png|Untitled 7 24.png]]
    

$d\sin\theta=m\lambda\quad m\in \Z\quad \text{(bright)}\\$

- for $\theta_m$ï»¿ the $m$ï»¿th value of $\theta$ï»¿ for the $m$ï»¿th bright band â†’ distance of any bright band from the center of the pattern is (for $R>>d$ï»¿)
    
    ![[/Untitled 8 22.png|Untitled 8 22.png]]
    

$y_m=R\tan\theta_m \approx R\sin\theta_m=R\frac{m\lambda}d\quad(y_m<<R)$

## Intensity of Interference

- for sources in phase, the electric fields at a point $P$ï»¿ differ by a phase angle of $\phi\propto r_2-r1$ï»¿

$E_P=2E\bigg|\cos\frac\phi2\bigg|$

$I=\frac12\epsilon_0cE^2_P=2\epsilon_0cE^2\cos^2\frac\phi2\\\space\\I_0=2\epsilon_0cE^2\quad(\phi=0)\\$

$I=I_0\cos^2\bigg(\frac{kd}2\sin\theta\bigg)=I_0\cos^2\bigg(\frac{\pi d}\lambda\sin\theta\bigg)$

$I=I_0\cos^2\bigg(\frac{kdy}{2R}\bigg)=I_0\cos^2\bigg(\frac{\pi dy}{\lambda R}\bigg)$

- the phase difference can b found by the ratio of path difference to wavelength:

$\frac\phi{2\pi}=\frac{r_2-r_1}\lambda\implies\phi=k(r_2-r_1)$

- then for interference in a material with refraction $n$ï»¿ and $k_0,\lambda_0$ï»¿ (wave number, wavelength in vacuum)

$\lambda=\frac{\lambda_0}n\implies k=nk_0$

- for a point $P$ï»¿ far away from sources relative to their separation $d$ï»¿ â†’ $r_2-r_1=d\sin\theta$ï»¿

$\phi=kd\sin\theta=\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda}\sin\theta$

## Thin Film Interference

- causes the reflection of bright bands in oily films s.t. the E-field amplitude $E_r$ï»¿ varies from the incidence value $E_i$ï»¿:
    
    ![[/Untitled 10 16.png|Untitled 10 16.png]]
    

$E_r=\frac{n_a-n_b}{n_a+n_b}E_i$

- So 3 cases - causes phase shift depending on refractive indices and thus the thicknesses can be expressed as a function of mth fringe

### Non-reflective coating

- Film thicknss is 1/4 of wavelength in the film â†’ half-wavlength path difference â†’ destructive interfere

### Michelson Interferometer

- used to measure wavelengths and small distances - allows moving a mirror to make fringes of monochromatic light for fringe positions given by
