## Magnetic Fields of a Moving Charge

- magnetic fields are determined at a point (distance) away from the source and depends on the velocity vector

$\vec B=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec v\times \hat r}{r^2}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec v\times \vec r}{r^3}\quad\text{st.}\quad \hat r=\frac{\vec r}{|\vec r|}$

- $\mu_0$Ôªø is the **permeability of free space** given as the magnetic constant

$\mu_0=4\pi\times10^{-7}\space [T\cdot \frac m A]$

- Field Lines:  
    the magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the velocity vector of the charge given by the ‚Äúcurled right hand rule‚Äù $\therefore \vec B=0\iff \vec r\times \vec v=0$Ôªø (i.e. point of measurement is on the velocity vector)

## due to a Straight Current Element

- for a current-carrying conductor segment with constant cross-sectional area $A$Ôªø, length $dl$Ôªø, and $n$Ôªø charges per unit volume of charge $q$Ôªø
- given total charge in the segment

$dQ=nqAdl\quad\quad Q=\int nqA\space dl$

- the magnitude of current through the wire

$I=n|q|v_d\cdot A=J\cdot A\quad\text{st.}\quad J=nqv_d$

### Biot-Savart Law (current elements)

$d\vec B=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{dQ(\vec v_d\times\hat r)}{r^2}=\frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\frac{d\vec l\times\hat r}{r^2}$

$\vec B=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int\frac{Id\vec l\times\hat r}{r^2}$

- Using Biot-Savart for a wire of length $l$Ôªø at a distance $r$Ôªø away is shown dependent to $r_\perp$Ôªø

$B=\frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\frac{l}{r_\perp\sqrt{r_\perp^2+(l/2)^2}}$

### Infinitely Long Wire

- a rigorous solution provided by Biot-Savart law
- field strength at a perpendicular distance $r$Ôªø from the wire

$B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r_\perp}$

### Between 2 parallel conductors (wires)

- given 2 infinitely long wires ‚Üí the direction of their currents tell us thheir interaction
- when in the same direction ‚Üí the wires attract each other through exerted attractive forces on each other
- we can find the force exerted by any given wire as:

$\vec F=I_1\vec L\times\vec B\\$

- this allows us to find force pr unit length of the wire:

$\frac F L=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi r}$

## due to a Circular Current Loop(s)

### Current Loop

- we can use Biot-Savart to find the differential parts of the field due to a loop with radius $a$Ôªø on its normal (central) axis $x$Ôªø distance away from the center

$dB=\frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\frac{dl}{x^2+a^2}$

- the radial components cancel out and we are left with only the field exerted in the direction of the normal vector

$dB_x=dB\cos\theta=\frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\frac{dl}{x^2+a^2}\frac{a}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}\\\space\\$

### Coil

- a coil can be represented as $N$Ôªø stacked current loops such that on the axis of the loop:

$B_x=\frac{\mu_0NIa^2}{2(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}\\$

- the **magnetic moment** for 1 loop is $\mu=I\pi a^2$Ôªø, so for $N$Ôªø loops ‚Üí $\mu=NI\pi a^2$Ôªø
- this implies the field can also be written as

$B_x=\frac{\mu_0\mu}{2\pi(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$

## Ampere‚Äôs Law

- Ampere‚Äôs law works on highly symmetric situations using the line integral in place of Gauss‚Äô flux on a closed path ($l$Ôªø) enclosing the current element
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 31.png|Untitled 6 31.png]]
    

$\oint\vec B\cdot d\vec l=\mu_0I_{\text{enc}}$

- it is intended to be used on an enclosed path such that $d\vec l\parallel\vec B$Ôªø
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 29.png|Untitled 7 29.png]]
    
- if $\oint\vec B\cdot d\vec l=0\implies I_{\text{enc}}=0$Ôªø NOT that the magnetic field is zero

  

## due to Cylindrical Conductor

- on a thick wire of outer radius $R$Ôªø with total current $I$Ôªø distributed evenly across the cross-sectional area of the conductor
- the enclosed charge can be expressed as

$I_{\text{enc}}=\frac{\pi r^2I}{\pi R^2}$

- magnetic field inside the conductor using Amperian loop of radius $r<R$Ôªø

$\oint\vec B\cdot d\vec l\implies B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi}\frac{r}{R^2}$

- field outside the conductor with Amperian loop of $r > R$Ôªø

$\oint\vec B\cdot d\vec l\implies B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}$

## due to a straight Solenoid

- magnetic field at the center of a solenoid of $n$Ôªø turns per unit length and current $I$Ôªøpassing through each turn using an Amperian loop through a length $L$Ôªø
- assume the solenoid is infinitely long as to define field lines as straight and contained within the solenoid (no leakage outside)

$I_{\text{enc}}=\frac{NIL}{L}=nLI$

$\oint vec B\cdot d\vec l=BL\implies B=\frac{\mu_0NI}{L}=\mu_0nI$

## due to a Toroidal Solenoid

- has N turns around a doughnut shaped ferrous metal
- the field lines are circular around the inside of the metal
- the central hollow region has $B=0$Ôªø
- the outside region has $B\approx0$Ôªø (due to helical windings instead of circular)
- **inside the solenoid**

$I_{\text{enc}}=NI\\\space\\$

## Bohr Magneton

- in atomic physics: magnetism begins with the motion of electrons
- we can model a quantum mechanically incorrect model of an electron with orbit of radius $r$Ôªø and tangential velocity $v$Ôªø
    
    ![[/Untitled 10 20.png|Untitled 10 20.png]]
    
- using the charge of the electron $e$Ôªø and period of motion $T$Ôªø

$I=\frac e T=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}$

- resulting magnetic moment

$\mu=IA=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}(\pi r^2)=\frac{evr}{2}$

- given the angular moment $L=mvr$Ôªø

$\mu=\frac{e}{2m}L$

### Quantized Angular Momentum

- atomic angular moment is quantized: its component of ang. mom. in any particular direction is an integer multiple of the reduced Planck‚Äôs constant: $\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}$Ôªø where $h=6.626\times 10^{-34}$Ôªø is Planck‚Äôs Constant
- thus for $L=\frac{h}{2\pi}$Ôªø the **Bohr Magneton**

$\mu_B=\frac{e}{2m}\frac{h}{2\pi}=\frac{eh}{4\pi m}=9.274\times10^{-24}\space[A\cdot m^2]$

- the spin of an electron is very close to the Bohr magneton

## Paramagnetism and Diamagnetism

- most orbital and spin magnetic moments are cancelled out, but in some materials, they can have a net magnetic moment on the order of Bohr Magneton
- if such materials are place in an external magnetic field $\vec B_0$Ôªø, the individual magnetic moments tend to align with the field ‚Üí produce another magnetic field proportional to total magnetic moment $\vec\mu_{\text{total}}$Ôªø of the material
- magnetization of a material is its magnetic moment per unit Volume

$\vec M=\frac{\vec\mu_{\text{total}}}{V}=\chi_m\frac {\vec B_0} {\mu_0}$

- therefore the total magnetic field is

$\vec B=\vec B_0+\mu_0\vec M=\vec B_0K_m$

- materials that exhibit this behavior are paramagnetic: the magnetic field inside the material is stronger than outside

### Diamagnetism

- paramagnetism implies the internal field is greater than an equivalent field in the vacuum around by a factor of $K_m$Ôªø known as the relative permeability of the material (i.e. depends on the material)
- this can give us the permeability ($\mu$Ôªø) of the material (NOT MAGNETIC MOMENT)

$\mu=K_m\mu_0$

- magnetic susceptibility is the amount the relative permeability differs from 1

$\chi_m=K_m-1$

- diamagnetism is the property that the internal fields of the material oppose the external field in direction such that $K_m<1$Ôªø

### Magnetism Table at 20 ¬∫C

![[/Untitled 11 18.png|Untitled 11 18.png]]

## Ferromagnetism

- ferromagnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt, etc.) have strong interactions between magnetic moments that cause magnetic moments to align parallel to each other in magnetic domains regardless of external magnetic field
- when there is no external fields, the magnetic fields are randomly oriented ‚Üí presence of magnetic field causes domains to orient in the net direction of the field ‚Üí most materials return to normal after being removed from the field ‚Üí ferromagnetic materials do not
- such materials are magnetized so their domains don‚Äôt revert (bar magnet, other magnets) and have relative permeabilities $K_m$Ôªø on the order of $10^3,\space10^5$Ôªø

### Hysteresis

- the behavior of the relationship of magnetization $M$Ôªø to the external magnetic field $B_0$Ôªø strength is hysteresis
    
    ![[/Untitled 12 18.png|Untitled 12 18.png]]
    
- this occurs until the material reaches saturation $M_{\text{sat}}$Ôªø
