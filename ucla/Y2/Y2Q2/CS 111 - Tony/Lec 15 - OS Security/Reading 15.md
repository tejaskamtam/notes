### Intro to OS Security

As a result, among the things  
the OS can do are:  
• examine or alter any process’s memory  
• read, write, delete or corrupt any file on any writeable persistent  
storage medium, including hard disks and flash drives  
• change the scheduling or even halt execution of any process  
• send any message to anywhere, including altered versions of those  
a process wished to send  
• enable or disable any peripheral device

-give any process access to any other process’s resources  
• arbitrarily take away any resource a process controls  
• respond to any system call with a maximally harmful lie

Goal:

- confidentiality
- integrity
- availability
