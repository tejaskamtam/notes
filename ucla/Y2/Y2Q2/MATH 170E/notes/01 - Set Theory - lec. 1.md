## Probability theory (statistics)

The practice of quantifying randomness

Set theory is important in creating concrete explanations of randomness

### Law of Large Numbers

- the expected distribution over the course of many tries, the long-term,

### Central Limit Theorem

- the distribution of randomness in the long-term given some specific constraints will result in a bell-shaped curve (Gaussian distribution)

## Set theory (review)

### Set difference

- denoted $B\setminus A \equiv B-A$ï»¿

### Universal set and Complement

- denoted $\Omega$ï»¿
- complement of $A$ï»¿ denoted $Aâ€™=\Omega|A$ï»¿

### Formulaic unions

- given sets $A_1,â€¦,A_k | k\in\mathbb{N}$ï»¿
- union $\cup_{j=1}^k A_j=A_1\cup...\cup A_k$ï»¿

### Formulaic intersections

- $\cap_{j=1}^k A_j = A_1\capâ€¦\cap A_k$ï»¿

### DeMorganâ€™s Law

- if $A_j\sube\Omega | j=1,â€¦,k,â€¦,\infin$ï»¿ then
- $(\cup_j^k A_j)â€™ = \cap_j^k A_j'$ï»¿
- $(\cap_j^k A_j)â€™=\cup_j^k A_j'$ï»¿
