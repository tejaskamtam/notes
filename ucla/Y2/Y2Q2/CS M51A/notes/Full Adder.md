## Full Adder

- sum of products

$Zi = X_iâ€™Y_iâ€™C_{in} + X_iâ€™Y_iC_{in}â€™ + X_iY_iâ€™C_{in}â€™ + X_iY_iC_{in}$

- product of sums

$Z_i = (X_i+Y_i+C_{in})(X_i+Y_iâ€™+C_{in}â€™)(X_iâ€™+Y_i+C_{in}â€™)(X_iâ€™+Y_iâ€™+C_{in})$

- singular addition unit with a carry forward capability and 2 parameters
- can be placed in series to carry forward addition parameters and carry bits
- truth table
    
    ![[/Untitled 1 31.png|Untitled 1 31.png]]
    
- equations can be written as:
    - $Zi=(Xi+Yi+Ci)â€¦(Xiâ€™+Yiâ€™+Ciâ€™)$ï»¿
