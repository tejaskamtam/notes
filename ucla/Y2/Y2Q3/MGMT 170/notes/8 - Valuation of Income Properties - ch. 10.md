- market value
    - price at which buyr and sller agree on at a particular time
- appraised. vaalue
    - an stimate or. opinion onproperty value for a particular purpose for a particular date, by an appraiser
- three methods of valuation:
    - Sales comparison
        - compares recent sales of highly comparable properties similar in location, size, age, construction quality
        - generally only method used for residential properties
        - one of three used for commercial properties
    - capitalization of income
        - gross rent multiplier (GRM)
            - annual rental income X gross rent multiplier = price (or value)
            - gross rent multiplier must bederived from the GRMs on sales of comparable properties
            - i.e. GRM = price / rental income (of comparable properties) then apply to subject property
            - simple method often used for apartment appraisal
        - capitalization of net operating income NOI
            - cap rate = NOI / Price (derived from comparable sales)
            - NOI / cap rate = price (or value)
            - capitalization (cap) raate derived from recent sales of comparable proprties - affected by market conditions
            - falling interest rates â†’ lower cap rates and vv.
            - increase in demand relative supply â†’ lower cap rates and vv.
        - Discounted present value (DCF) of projected future NOI
            - a 10yr cash flow model
            - dicount rate (or required internal rate of return) based on byerâ€™s assessment of risk of achieving projected NOI and projected future sale price
            - relative to current alternative investment and capital market benchmarks
    - replacment cost
        - sum of land value + depreciated replacment cost of improvements
        - dpreeciation of building can com from physical deprciation, functional obsolescnce, and extrnal obsolescence (effects of others i.e. sewage plants nearby, train stations, etc)
        - land value is derived from comparable sales analysis of similar land plots
        - replacment cost is more reliable when improvements are relatively new
        - may be vastly different from reality due to cost of time, unknown future market conditions on both properties and cost of materials to build a property
        - i.e. find cost of a comparable land plot + cost to construct new property = price (or value)
- land value
    - a highest and best use analysis to determine value of particular land site
    - regardless of whteher land is vacant or improved
    - particular land plot may be worth more if the existing improvements are demolished and removed
