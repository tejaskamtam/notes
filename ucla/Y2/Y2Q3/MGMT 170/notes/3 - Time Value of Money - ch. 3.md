## Compound Interest

- $(1+i)^n$ï»¿
- $i$ï»¿ is the periodic interest rate; $n$ï»¿ is the number of periods compunded

### Compounding (PV)

- Getting FV from PV

$\text{FV}=\text{PV}\cdot (1+i)^n$

### Discounting (FV)

- Getting PV from FV

$\text{PV}=\text{FV}\div (1+i)^n $

## Annuities (PMT)

- Investments with constant future periodic payments

## Investment Metrics: NPV, IRR, Risk

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- Present value of all projected future cash flows discounted at a Discount Rate:
- MINUS/LESS the cost of investment

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

- Discount rate at which:
- PV of all projected future cash flows = cost of investment

### Risk

- a metric to determine whether expected return is worth the cost of capital in the perceived risk
