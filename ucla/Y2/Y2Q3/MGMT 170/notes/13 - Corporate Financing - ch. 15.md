- Lease vs Own analysis
    - factor include: space (Relative to property), time (short/long),
    - risk from owning, control and management, maintnance and special purpose,
    - tax benefits from depreciaton, cost of capital
    - impact on financial statements (now irrelevant due to ASC 842 of the FASB)
- residual value
    - proprty’s projected future residual (exit) value
    - usually not a decison factor forr corps
    - company could negotiate a lease with an “equity kicker” or purchase option for future value
- corporate real estate financing
    - aacquiston of properrty can be fnanced with mortgage debt or unsecured corporate borrowing
    - mortage debt is usually preferred if its cheapeer than the company’s borrowingg cost
    - corporate creditt desk has NO security instrument ONLY promissory note IF credit is good enough: B-BBB, A+
- capital lease
    - formerrly:
    - if a lease term exceeded 75% of an asset’s remaiinng economic life
    - OR PV of future lease payment was the majorrity if the Property’s FMV (future market value) at lease commencement (90%+)
    - OR if property ownership is likeely to be transferred to the lessee upon expiration (purchase way option below FMV)
    - THEN lease was trreated as a apital lease and reported ass if that part of the asset was owned by the lessee
- finance vs operating lease
    - under recent ASC 842 of the FASB: PV of all lease payments for leases > 1 yr mut be capitalized and reported on the balance sheet a right-of-ue aset and lease liability
    - and annuaal leae payments reported as an expense on income statement
    - if lease term ≤ 1yr lease paymentswill bereeported on the expense on income sstatement but not balance sheet
- sale-leaseback (previously)
    - company might sell a propeerty and simultaneouly lease it back on a long term basis to obtain cash while retaining use of property
    - might negotiate repurchase option into the lease
    - this (a sale leaseback) is doen so its written as an operating lease thus off balance sheeet financing (now not true due to ASC 842 of FASB)
- hidden corporate real estate value
    - companies required to report property values at the lower of depreciated cost or market value
    - can lead to publicly traded company to become an acquisition target (completely) if their properties’ market value substantially exceeds reported depreciated book value
