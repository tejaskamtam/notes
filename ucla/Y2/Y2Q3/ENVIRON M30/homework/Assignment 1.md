# Notes

Hozier's "Take Me to Church" is a modern music video that could be analyzed for its portrayal of nature, wilderness, and pastoralism, but it doesn't directly tie into the evangelical idealism of purity as requested.

The music video for "Take Me to Church" features footage of Hozier singing in a rundown church, as well as images of two men in a romantic relationship. While the video doesn't necessarily depict nature or wilderness, the lyrics of the song contain references to natural elements such as "worship in the bedroom" and "a lover's hideaway." The themes of love, sexuality, and religion in the video could also be analyzed for their commentary on the relationship between human desire and religious dogma.

In terms of pastoralism, the video could be interpreted as depicting a desire for a simpler, more authentic life away from the constraints of organized religion. The crumbling church setting and the focus on personal relationships rather than institutional religion could be seen as a rejection of societal norms and a desire for freedom.

Overall, while "Take Me to Church" may not directly tie into the evangelical idealism of purity, it does offer a complex and nuanced portrayal of religion, sexuality, and personal freedom.

## Intro

Hozier's "Take Me to Church" uses pastoralism as a vehicle to express the themes of personal freedom and authenticity through the natural world. The song contrasts rural life with modern society, highlighting the tension between the two, while emphasizing the beauty and power of the natural world. By exploring the relationship between wilderness and personal identity, the song calls for a reflection on the importance of preserving nature for future generations. Through a critical analysis of the song's use of natural imagery and the role of music and art in promoting alternative ideals and challenging societal norms, this essay argues that "Take Me to Church" romanticizes pastoralism as a means of conveying personal freedom and authenticity.

## 1 - Romanticism of nature and the pastoral

In "Take Me to Church," Hozier presents a romanticized vision of pastoralism through both lyrical and scenic elements. The opening line, "My lover's got humor, she's the giggle at a funeral," sets the stage for the rest of the song's use of natural imagery to evoke a sense of pastoral paradise. The lyrics continue to describe the couple's relationship as "a fresh poison each week," a metaphor for the intoxicating and wild nature of love that is often associated with the untamed beauty of nature. This connection between nature, love, and personal freedom is further emphasized in the music video, which features the couple frolicking in a field surrounded by trees and birds. The emphasis on the beauty and power of the natural world is evident in the vivid descriptions of "worship[ping] like a dog at the shrine of your lies" and "I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife." These lyrics depict the raw, primal nature of the characters' love, which is contrasted with the complexity and corruption of modern society. The scenic elements of the music video further highlight this contrast, as the couple's pastoral paradise is juxtaposed with images of a church, a group of men in suits, and a cityscape. Overall, Hozier's use of natural imagery and scenic elements in "Take Me to Church" serves to romanticize pastoralism and portray nature as a symbol of personal freedom and authenticity.

In addition to the use of natural imagery, the music video also highlights the connection between nature, love, and personal freedom. This is evident in the scene where Hozier and his partner are lying on the grass in a field, looking up at the sky. The vastness of the sky and the beauty of the landscape around them create a sense of wonder and awe. This moment of intimacy and vulnerability is framed by the natural world, suggesting that their love is part of the larger tapestry of the universe.

Furthermore, the video emphasizes the beauty and power of the natural world through stunning scenic shots. From the rolling hills and lush forests to the serene lakes and waterfalls, the viewer is constantly reminded of the majesty and magnificence of nature. This romanticization of pastoralism is further reinforced by the contrast between the simplicity of rural life and the complexities of modern society. In one scene, Hozier is shown sitting alone in a dark, sterile room, surrounded by technology and machinery. This serves as a stark contrast to the scenes of him wandering through fields, wading in streams, and communing with nature.

Through these examples, it becomes clear that Hozier's "Take Me to Church" romanticizes pastoralism and nature as a symbol of personal freedom and authenticity. The connection between nature, love, and personal freedom is a central theme, and the beauty and power of the natural world are emphasized throughout the video. Additionally, the contrast between the simplicity of rural life and the complexities of modern society underscores the appeal of a simpler, more natural way of life.

## 2 (Optional) - Wilderness as a symbol of authenticity

Hozier's "Take Me to Church" utilizes wilderness as a symbol of personal freedom and authenticity. The music video portrays urban spaces as oppressive and stifling, with dimly lit streets and confined spaces. In contrast, the natural world is shown as a refuge and sanctuary, with lush green forests, open fields, and bright, expansive skies. This dichotomy is emphasized in the lyrics, with lines such as "Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week" highlighting the negative effects of urban life. The music video depicts the protagonist's journey from the city to the countryside, symbolizing a desire to escape the constraints of modern society and find personal freedom in the natural world. Additionally, the video connects wilderness to personal identity, with the protagonist shedding his urban clothes and assuming a more natural, unencumbered appearance. Hozier also emphasizes the importance of preserving nature for future generations, with shots of clear streams and vibrant foliage serving as a call to action for viewers to protect the natural world. Overall, Hozier's "Take Me to Church" presents wilderness as a symbol of personal freedom and authenticity, contrasting it with the oppressive nature of urban life and emphasizing the importance of preserving nature for future generations.

In addition to the visual imagery of the music video, "Take Me to Church" also conveys its message through the lyrics. Hozier uses the metaphor of the church to represent societal norms and the pressures to conform. The lyrics suggest that the church (society) has become oppressive and stifling, forcing individuals to hide their true selves and desires. In contrast, the wilderness and natural world are depicted as a refuge and sanctuary, where individuals can find solace and freedom from societal constraints. This is conveyed in lyrics such as "If I'm a pagan of the good times / My lover's the sunlight / To keep the goddess on my side / She demands a sacrifice." Here, Hozier suggests that true happiness and personal fulfillment can be found in nature and through living an authentic life. The song also emphasizes the importance of preserving nature for future generations, further underscoring the idea of personal freedom and the importance of being true to oneself.

Hozier's "Take Me to Church" depicts nature and wilderness as a symbol of personal identity and freedom. The music video presents the urban space as oppressive and stifling, and the natural world as a refuge and sanctuary where one can escape the complexities and constraints of modern society. In the video, the protagonist finds solace in the woods, where he can express his true self and embrace his identity without fear of judgment or persecution. The lyrics reinforce this idea, as Hozier sings, "I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife / Offer me that deathless death / Good God, let me give you my life." By seeking refuge in nature, the protagonist is able to embrace his true self and surrender to the natural world, offering himself up to something greater than himself. This connection between wilderness and personal identity is reinforced by the imagery in the video, which highlights the beauty and power of nature and emphasizes the importance of preserving it for future generations. By portraying the natural world as a symbol of personal freedom and authenticity, "Take Me to Church" challenges societal norms and encourages viewers to embrace their true selves and seek refuge in the wilderness.

## 3 - Pastoralism and personal freedom

In the music video, Hozier portrays pastoralism as an idealized concept, which contrasts with the complexities and restrictions of modern society. The video juxtaposes scenes of Hozier and his lover in a lush, natural setting with footage of a violent, oppressive institution. This contrast highlights the tension between the idyllic simplicity of rural life and the complicated realities of contemporary society. Through the lens of pastoralism, the music video suggests that personal freedom can be found in a simpler way of life, free from the constraints of modernity. The connection between nature and personal freedom is also evident in the video, as the natural setting serves as a sanctuary for Hozier and his lover, a space where they can escape the oppressive forces of society and be true to themselves. This emphasis on personal freedom and authenticity aligns with the ideas of the sublime, in which nature is a powerful symbol of human emotions and experiences. The music video suggests that music and art can promote alternative ideals and challenge societal norms, as Hozier uses his music to advocate for the importance of personal freedom and self-expression.

n the music video, the portrayal of rural life is depicted as a simpler and more authentic way of living compared to modern urban life. This depiction aligns with the ideals of pastoralism, which often romanticizes the simplicity and closeness to nature of rural life. The connection between pastoralism and personal freedom can also be seen in the video's depiction of a same-sex relationship in a conservative, rural community. This relationship challenges societal norms and expectations, demonstrating the idea that personal freedom and authenticity may require breaking away from traditional social structures and norms. Furthermore, the use of the natural world as a symbol of personal freedom and authenticity in the video reinforces the connection between pastoralism and personal freedom.
