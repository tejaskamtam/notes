# Notes

"Four kinds of pastoral" is an essay by Terry Gifford, a scholar of ecocriticism and environmental literature. In this essay, Gifford explores four different approaches to pastoral literature, a genre that idealizes and romanticizes rural life, nature, and often the role of a shepherd or other rural figure.

The first approach is the "classical" or "traditional" pastoral, which dates back to ancient Greece and Rome. In this type of pastoral, shepherds and other rural figures are portrayed as living in harmony with nature, and the pastoral landscape is idealized and often set apart from the realities of urban life.

The second approach is the "realist" or "georgic" pastoral, which emerged in the 18th century. In this type of pastoral, the focus is less on idealizing rural life and more on the practical aspects of agriculture and rural labor. The georgic pastoral emphasizes the hard work of farming and the importance of a productive, sustainable relationship with nature.

The third approach is the "romantic" pastoral, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In this type of pastoral, nature is seen as a source of inspiration and spirituality, and the pastoral landscape is often associated with the sublime. The romantic pastoral also often includes a sense of nostalgia for a simpler, more idyllic way of life.

The fourth and final approach is the "modern" or "post-pastoral," which emerged in the 20th century. In this type of pastoral, there is a greater awareness of the environmental and social issues that affect rural areas, and the pastoral landscape is often presented as a site of conflict rather than harmony. The modern pastoral also often includes a critique of the idealization of rural life and the shepherd figure, and may instead emphasize the voices and experiences of marginalized or oppressed rural communities.

Overall, Gifford's essay provides a useful framework for understanding the evolution of pastoral literature and the different ways in which nature and rural life have been idealized and romanticized over time. By examining these different approaches, Gifford suggests that the pastoral genre can be a valuable tool for exploring our relationship with nature and the ways in which that relationship has evolved over time.
