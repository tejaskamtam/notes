### Characteristic Megafauna

- Media likes to focus on characteristic megafauna: animalia, vertebrates, mammals, birds, amphibians
- this excludes multtudes of other species of not only animalia, but plants and microbiologcal organisms

### Ivory-bill Woodpecker

- Alexander Wilsonâ€™s American Ornithology captures the idea of 1800s naturalists as they go to greeat lengths to understand wildliife to the point of killing the animal life
- Lee Hylaâ€™s musical Wilsonâ€™ss Ivory bill â†’ shows the macabre nature of wilson and other past ornithologists on the study of now extinct species like the ivory bill woodpecker
- the extinction of the species hugely motivates bird-watchers and ornithologists to try to find the species post-mortem instead of trying to save current endangered species â†’ highlights the american pursuit of things long gone and our blindness to currently endangered species

### Virunga

- Malika - war orphan
- post
    - Virunga is fascinating, as a unique form of media from what we've seen so far and how it emphasizes the need to maintain rich biodiversity worldwide. As we discussed, the endangered species list is often abridged to focus on the small slice of Animalia media likes to focus on. Conversely, Virunga is entirely focused on a single ranger in a national park that many may not have heard of, protecting the mountain back gorillas we've become accustomed to seeing at zoos. This unique perspective helps readers understand Malika and why she feels the need to protect the wildlife in his national park. Overall, the graphic novel helped me understand why it is we choose to preserve biodiversity and why it is so essential for us to continue to advocate for the conservation of biodiversity: it's a moral obligation we have to the world for all the resources, land, and developments we've taken and made across history.
