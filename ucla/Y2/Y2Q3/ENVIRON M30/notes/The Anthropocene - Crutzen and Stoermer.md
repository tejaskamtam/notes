## The Anthropocene by Crutzen and Stoermer

## Lecture - Viewpoints

- The epoch dictated by significant human change on the Earth
- can be seen with the shared hockey stick graphs of socio-economic impact and global metrics (green house gasses, ocean acidification, climate change)

### When

- Many viewpoints:
    - 8000 y.a. - with agriculture
    - 15th cent. - with colonization
    - 18th cent. - with industrialization
- Really looking at it - with globalization post WW2 ca. 1950s

### What (Viewpoints)

- Many viewpoint - bad and good
    - dictated by the negative impact off humanity‚Äôs actions on earth - climate change, etc.
    - Others say its good - a moment of taking action and changing our negative impacts
- negative viewpoint is dominant due to significance of climate change
- tries to move the viewpoint of environmentalism to the current effects of humans on the world ‚Üí gives humans exceptionalism (environmentalists push back against this viewpoint)
- activists question the ‚Äúwe‚Äù of Anthropocene as collectively underrepresenting the effects between global north and south on the environmental impact (north - US, Europe; south - Asia, Pacific south)
- mostly a global north movement - not very influential in East Asia, Latin America - suggested due to cultural differences
