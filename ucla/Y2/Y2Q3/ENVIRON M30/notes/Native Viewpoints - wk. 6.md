# Discussion

What dos dystopia mean to you?

The end of free will.

What do you think o environmental dystopia?

The end of nature. Nature as in the sense of the value for it. In the past countles civilizations had worshipped or. at. last taken a stance on conservationalism but a dystopian environment or environmental dystopia would signify the end of conservationism and mass conumption with complete disregard to the care for sustainability and use. Manufacturing and big corp would own a mjority of the natural resource on Earth in which they have complete disregard for the will of individuals in caring or replanting the environment. Government ceases to protect the individual and their beliefs in terms of caroing for nature. Its an all for one society.
