# Summaries and Notes

- Overarching
    
    My First Summer in the Sierra is a book written by John Muir, documenting his experiences and observations during his first summer in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. The book is essentially a journal that covers the period from June 27th to September 19th, 1869.
    
    In the early entries, Muir describes his journey to the Sierra Nevada, which he entered from the Central Valley. He was struck by the beauty and grandeur of the mountains, and he was eager to explore them. He describes the various trees, flowers, and animals he encountered on his way up the mountains, including the giant sequoias and the coyotes.
    
    Once he reached the high Sierra, Muir embarked on several exploratory trips, hiking and climbing to various points of interest. He describes in detail the landscapes he encounters, including the Yosemite Valley and the mountains and glaciers surrounding it. He also provides detailed observations of the plants and animals he encounters, including the various birds that inhabit the area.
    
    On July 3rd, Muir reaches the summit of Mount Hoffmann, which he describes as "the culminating point of my first high Sierra excursion". He describes the view from the summit as "one of the most extensive and sublime views to be found in any mountain chain in the world". From there, he is able to see many of the other peaks in the Sierra, including Mounts Lyell and Dana.
    
    On July 11th, Muir continues his exploration, heading towards the Tuolumne Meadows. He describes the meadows as "a smooth, silky lawn, adorned with groups of the noblest trees I have ever seen". He spends several days in the meadows, exploring and studying the area's flora and fauna.
    
    Overall, My First Summer in the Sierra is a fascinating and detailed account of John Muir's experiences in the Sierra Nevada mountains. It provides an intimate look at the natural beauty of the region and the adventures of one of America's most famous naturalists.
    
- Core questions
    1. How does Muir describe the landscape of the Sierra Nevada?  
        Muir's descriptions of the landscape of the Sierra Nevada are vivid and detailed, as he was deeply impressed by the beauty and grandeur of the region. He describes the mountains as "heavenly" and "majestic", and marvels at the vastness of the landscapes. Muir's descriptions often focus on the geological features of the region, including the glaciers, lakes, and valleys. He also notes the variety of plant life, such as the giant sequoias, which he describes as "noble and beautiful". His descriptions convey a sense of wonder and awe at the natural world around him.
    2. What cognitive and emotional changes does the landscape trigger in Muir?  
        The landscape of the Sierra Nevada triggers significant cognitive and emotional changes in Muir. He is deeply moved by the beauty of the region, and his descriptions reflect a profound sense of wonder and awe. Muir's experiences in the mountains also lead him to question his previous beliefs about nature and the role of humans in the natural world. He begins to see nature as something to be revered and protected, rather than exploited for human gain. Muir's experiences in the Sierra Nevada also had a profound impact on his personal and professional life, as they inspired him to become a prominent conservationist and advocate for the preservation of natural spaces.
    3. What happens with ideas of pastoral and wilderness in Muir?  
        Muir's experiences in the Sierra Nevada led him to challenge traditional ideas of pastoral and wilderness landscapes. Prior to his time in the mountains, Muir had subscribed to the idea of the pastoral landscape as a cultivated, human-controlled space. However, his experiences in the Sierra Nevada led him to see nature as inherently valuable and worthy of protection, rather than something to be tamed or exploited. Muir's views on wilderness also changed as a result of his experiences in the Sierra Nevada. He came to see wilderness not as a barren, inhospitable landscape, but as a vibrant and valuable ecosystem that deserved to be protected. Muir's writings and activism played a significant role in the development of the American conservation movement, which sought to protect natural spaces for their own sake, rather than solely for human use.
    4. How does Muir view Native Americans?  
        Muir's views on Native Americans are complex and reflect the attitudes of his time. He refers to Native Americans as "Indians" and often characterizes them as primitive and uncivilized. He also describes them as being in harmony with nature and notes their skills in hunting and fishing. At times, Muir seems to romanticize Native Americans, portraying them as noble savages who live in harmony with the natural world. However, he also notes their struggles and the injustices they have suffered at the hands of white settlers.
        
        Overall, Muir's views on Native Americans are influenced by the prevailing attitudes of his time, which often saw indigenous peoples as inferior and in need of assimilation. However, his experiences in the Sierra Nevada also led him to appreciate the value of Native American knowledge and their relationship with the natural world.
        
    5. Muir claims that he'd love to stay in the wilderness, never go back, and live the simple life. So why does he go back in the end?  
        Muir's desire to stay in the wilderness reflects his deep connection to and appreciation for the natural world. He is moved by the beauty of the Sierra Nevada and the sense of freedom and independence that he experiences there. He also sees the wilderness as a place of simplicity and purity, free from the corrupting influence of modern society.
        
        However, Muir ultimately decides to leave the wilderness and return to civilization for a few reasons. First, he recognizes that he has a duty to share his experiences with others and to advocate for the protection of the natural world. Second, he acknowledges that he cannot survive in the wilderness alone and that he needs the support and resources of society to continue his work. Finally, he recognizes that his experiences in the wilderness have changed him in profound ways, and that he has a responsibility to use his newfound knowledge and appreciation of nature to make a difference in the world.
        
        In the end, Muir's decision to leave the wilderness is a reflection of his desire to share his experiences with others and to use his knowledge and influence to protect the natural world.
        

# Lecture

- Masterplots - Abbot
    
    - very loosely conceived in the literature but seemingly universal as it speaks of common cultural significances
    - the closer it ties to cultural significance, the stronger t is perceived
    
      
    
- art and literature in the period of Muir ca. 1868 - depicts nature as divine with christian ideals of the divinity of nature - thought of as ‚Äúsublime‚Äù ‚Üí divine but ominous possibly characterized by the holiness of god and the fear god instills in christians

## The wilderness Masterplot

- NA American environmentalism has landed on the ideal nature is untouched by humans
- not shared by cultures in east and south asa and Native Americans
- this never used to be the case before as evidenced by plantationists like Mather in 1663-1728 - nature is wild, horrible, godless, and put there to test our faith - people who lived there (native americans) were satanic creatures
- industrialization of the 1800s drastically changed this perspective - saw humans could significantly impact nature and the environment and should therefore take precautions to safeguard and experience it while it is still divine - ‚Äúin wildness is the preservation of the world‚Äù (‚ÄùWalking,‚Äù Thoreau 1861)
- Muir co-founded the Sierra Club (known as one of the first activists for environmentalism) and was a STRONG activist against the Hetch Hetchy dam (ultimately lost)

## My First Summer in Sierra

- Goes to the Sierra with a Shepherd on a sheep herding operation - comes to despise/be annoyed by the sheep and instead finds absolution in nature
- was condescending and racist n thought of the Native Americans (a shared view among americans during the time period) - but associates them with nature although savages

### Wilderness - the Divine

- "The whole landscape showed design, like man's noblest sculptures" (14).
- "Beauty beyond thought everywhere, beneath, above, made and being made forever" (14).
- "glad to be a servant of servants in so holy a wilderness" (16)
- "a noble sugar pine"; "a glorious tree" (17)
- "definite symbols, divine hieroglyphics written with sunbeams" (21)
- "solemn-sounding waterfalls and many small soothing voices in sweet accord whispering peace!" (32)
- "spring work is going on with joyful enthusiasm, new life, new beauty, unfolding, unrolling in glorious exuberant extravagance . . . new leaves, new flowers, spreading, shining, rejoicing everywhere" (32-33)
- "Another glorious Sierra day . . . This is true freedom, a good practical sort of immortality" (39).
- "this June seems the greatest of all the months of my life, the most truly, divinely free, boundless like eternity, immortal. Everything in it seems equally divine ‚Äì one smooth, pure, wild glow of Heaven's love" (68)
- "The whole wilderness seems to be alive and familiar, full of humanity"(238).
- "plant-people" (244)
- connections of christian divinity with scientific knowledge of nature - a heavy focus on anything and everything untouched by civilized humanity
- controversies of Muir‚Äôs perspectives of Native Americans - he was condescending of uncivilized people, racist, derogatory toward other races and a conservationist of the white race
- the environmentalist movement ha over time had profound effects on legislation: see the US Wilderness Act - 1964
    - allocates acres of federal land to remain untouched (untainted) by humanity allowing solitude exploration and experience of nature and the status quo present in the area
    - shaped the american environmentalism as conservationism and preservationism
    - this had negative impacts on the native americans in thee lands, many were displaced to claim the land as national parks, see: Yosemite built on the displacement of Ahwahneechee during the Mariposa war between California soldiers
