## Environmental Justice Movement

The Environmental Justice movement seeks to ensure that all individuals, regardless of race, class, or other social factors, have access to clean air, water, and soil. The movement emerged in response to the disproportionate impact of environmental pollutants on marginalized communities, particularly communities of color and low-income communities.

Environmental Justice activists work to address the systemic causes of environmental degradation and to hold corporations and governments accountable for their environmental impact. They also work to empower communities to advocate for their own environmental health and to promote sustainable and equitable development.

The Environmental Justice movement has had significant successes in raising public awareness of environmental inequalities and securing policy changes to address environmental injustices. However, much work remains to be done to ensure that all individuals have access to a healthy environment and to address the root causes of environmental degradation.

Shlosberg's environmental justice paradigms consist of three distinct frames through which environmental issues can be analyzed. The first frame is distributive justice, which focuses on the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens across different communities. The second frame is procedural justice, which refers to the fairness and inclusiveness of decision-making processes related to environmental issues. The third frame is participatory justice, which emphasizes the importance of involving affected communities in the decision-making process. Together, these three frames provide a comprehensive lens through which to view environmental justice issues.

In recent years, the concept of environmental justice has become increasingly important in discussions about environmental policy and activism. Environmental justice refers to the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, or income, in the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. This includes issues such as access to clean air and water, safe and healthy living conditions, and protection from environmental hazards.
