## Lecture

- Skywoman Falling suggests humanity is exceptional from nature and has “descended upon” nature where the world introduces humanity to nature
- reciprocity is crucial in terms of interacting with nature, how can we give back for the resources nature has given us
- skywoman creates a garden and eats from it and. provides a blessing unto the world while in Genesis Eve is banished from the garden of eden for eating the fruit
- the original indigenous woman upon earth was an immigrant - an exception to nature, and so she must learn to accommodate and reciprocate - the author is a member of an indigenous group and suggests humanity is similarly “thrown into the world”
- so, the reciprocal interactions between humanity and nature is nature itself, one and independent - there is no

### Are humans part of nature

- Great Chan of Being suggests humans had their place in the natural order if God and Angels above them and animals below them
- Darwinism and biological explanations ground ourselves scientifically into nature
- in pagan and some Christian narratives, humans were originally “natural” - simple, innocent, happy but we then lost that connection when we developed society civilization: got us pat savagery but separated from nature

### Ecology

- the study of how organisms are distributed in space/time and why they are that way via they’re abundance and interactions with nature
- the 1960’s pushed a movement/narrative that reenforced the idea that ecology s a more holistic synthesis than an analytical microscopy like the other sciences → used synonymously with environmentalism but was not true then and is not now, ecology is more the biological study of the dispersion and interactions of organisms
- 1980s-1990s “Deep Ecology” Movement
    - rejected mainstream environmentalists like Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy
    - moved focus away from political push for change but instead focused on a belief system of non-human worth and pushed for human equivalency to nature (not exceptional beings)

  

### Environmentalism(s) - many flavors

- a social movement that emerged in thee middle of the 20th century (1960s during Civil Rights alongside feminism, anti-colonialism, etc.)
- believe humanity is degrading, destroying, natural environments and aim to halt/reverse degradation
- others want to preserve the environment for its own sake → invoke sense of “balance” between humanity and nature and living in harmony
- many groups push against modernity, industrialization, capitalism, urbanization, etc. (mostly changed ca. 2000 with ecological modernists)
- preceded by Romanticism with the realization that humanity threatens nature

### Ecosystem

- coined by Arthur Tansley in 1955 - a community of organisms and their symbiosis with non-living “neighbors”
- BUT they are hard to identify/categorize especially with human developments (”novel ecosystem”)

### Environment

- broad term for natural and/or built environments, physical and meta-physical, etc.
- connected to nature since conservationists of the 1960s → frees from the specificity of nature with a more encompassing term
- can be a strength or weakness a a unifying term or a weekly defined specification
