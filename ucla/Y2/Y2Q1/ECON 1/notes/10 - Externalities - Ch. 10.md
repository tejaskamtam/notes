- social surplus

    - quantity that maximizes social surplus

# Big Ideas

## Negative Externality

- e.g. pollution, barking dog, noise pollution, health risks, etc.
- e.g. market for gasoline

- tax would increase supply to compensate for social dwl

## Positive Externality

- social value includes
    - private value
    - external benefit
- e.g. flu shot market

- subsidy would increase demand to compensate for social dwl

## Corrective Taxes/Subsidies

### Corrective Tax

- tax designed to induce private decision-makers to account for social costs from negative externality

### Pigouvian Tax

- tax on good with external costs
- e.g. $1 tax on gasoline to close social dwl

### Pigouvian Subsidy

- subsidy on goods with external benefits
- e.g. $10 subsidy on flu shots to close social dwl

## Solutions to Externality Problems

- tax incentivizes firms to adopt cleaner tech instead of meeting minimum regulation

### Private Solutions

- transaction costs
    - all the costs necessary for an agreement
- e.g. moral codes, social sanctions, charities, contracts with bystanders

### Coase Theorem

- if transaction costs are low and property rights are clearly defined â†’ private bargains will ensure market equilibrium is efficient even in externalities

### Limitations

- transaction costs
    - costs may make it impossible to reach an agreement
- stubbornness
    - parties may not agree in search of a better deal
- coordination problems
    - if parties are large, coordinating transaction costs can be difficult to impossible

### Government Solutions

- taxes and subsidies
    - note Pigouvian taxes/subsidies
- command and control
    - mandate lower/higher quantities relative to market level
    - donâ€™t always work â†’ situations like pandemic need control
- tradable allowances (market-based policies)
    - establish a tradable allowances market and set rations/maximums to players in the market
    - e.g.
