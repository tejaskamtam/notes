## Supplemental Definitions

---

- surplus
    - when $Q_S$Ôªø exceeds $Q_D$Ôªø at a price point
- shortage
    - when $Q_D$Ôªø exceeds $Q_S$Ôªø at a price point
- elasticity
    - the responsiveness of quantity demanded/supplied to price changes

## Big Ideas

---

### Price Control

**Price Ceiling**

A legal maximum price on a good or service

  

**Price Floor**

A legal minimum on the price of a good/service

  

**Binding**

1. For Price Ceilings:
    
    1. If the cap is below the equilibrium price ‚Üí causes a shortage
    
    - e.g. binding cap
        
        ![[/Untitled 9.png|Untitled 9.png]]
        
2. For Price Floors
    
    1. If the floor is above the equilibrium price ‚Üí cases a surplus
    
    - e.g. binding
        
        ![[/Untitled 1 4.png|Untitled 1 4.png]]
        

### Price Ceiling

Shortages are smaller in the short run and larger in the long run

  

**Effects**

1. Shortages
    1. when price control is binding, there exists a shortage
    2. the lower the price ceiling to the equilibrium, the larger the shortage
2. Reduction in quality
    1. to match consumer demand, sellers can reduce quality or service to meet demand at the binding price
3. Wasteful lines/costs of search (bribes)
    1. buyers may bee willing to bribe sellers to obtain goods in a shortage
    2. highest bribe = max price (willing) - price ceiling
        1. implies, maximum wait time = max price - price cap
    3. if bribes are common:
        1. total price of good = legal cap + bribe
    4. when time costs are competitive:
        1. total price = legal price + time costs + bribe
4. Lost gains from trade
    
    1. deadweight loss - total of lost surplus when all profitable gains from trade are not exploited
        1. loss = lost consumer surplus + lost producer surplus
    2. happens when there is a shortage as consumers value the good more than cost of production
    
    - e.g. binding ceiling
        
        ![[/Untitled 2 5.png|Untitled 2 5.png]]
        
5. misallocation of resources
    
    1. controls eliminate incentives and distort consumer signals ‚Üí misallocation of resources
    2. consumers who value a good cannot signal to suppliers by increasing the market price
    3. leads to misallocation of goods in the market
    
    - e.g. artificially low prices
        
        ![[/Untitled 3 2.png|Untitled 3 2.png]]
        

  

### Price Floor

Uncommon, usually on wages

Does not usually effect high-skill labor

  

**Effects**

1. Surplus
    1. minimum wage laws create a surplus of labor willing to work and not enough demand to hire
    2. more people are willing to work at a higher wage
    3. fewer companies willing to pay a higher wage ‚Üí higher fewer employees
2. Lost gains from trade (deadweight loss)
    
    1. deadweight loss
    
    - e.g.
        
        ![[/Untitled 4 2.png|Untitled 4 2.png]]
        
3. Wasteful increase in quality
    
    1. sellers will compete in quality if market price cannot be lowered
    2. thus, wasted quality ‚Üí reduces profits and buyers unwilling to pay high prices, regardless of quality:
    
    - e.g.
        
        ![[/Untitled 5 2.png|Untitled 5 2.png]]
        
4. Misallocation of resources
    1. lead to high-cost firms competing
    2. ween out low-cost firms from market share
    3. e.g.
        1. price floors ‚Üí companies prevented from entering national market

### Taxes

taxes on goods/services ‚Üí revenue for government goods/services

e.g. national defense, public schools, social security

  

1. **Commodity tax**
    
    a tax on goods
    
    - who pays the tax is determined by relative elasticity of supply and demand
    - raises revenue ‚Üí creates dead-weight loss from trade

  

1. **Tax Shifts Supply and Demand**
    
    Tax on sellers - shifts supply up by the amount of the tax:
    
    - e.g. tax on sellers
        
        ![[/Untitled 6 2.png|Untitled 6 2.png]]
        
    
    Tax on buyers - shifts demand down by the amount of the tax:
    
    - e.g. tax on buyers
        
        ![[/Untitled 7 2.png|Untitled 7 2.png]]
        

  

1. **Incidence of a Tax**
    
    how the burden of tax is shared among market participants: buyers, sellers
    
    - e.g. incidence
        
        ![[/Untitled 8 2.png|Untitled 8 2.png]]
        

  

1. **Tax Wedge**
    
    the difference in the price paid by buyers and the price sellers receive:
    
    - e.g. tax edge $1
        
        ![[/Untitled 9 2.png|Untitled 9 2.png]]
        

  

1. **Elasticity and tax incidence**
    
    who pays the tax is determined by which curve is less elastic:
    
    - e.g. supply is more elastic than demand ‚Üí buyers less likely to leave the market
        
        ![[/Untitled 10.png|Untitled 10.png]]
        
    
      
    
2. **Effects of Tax Visualized**
    
    ![[/Untitled 11.png|Untitled 11.png]]
    

### Subsidies

- a ‚Äúreverse tax‚Äù where govts pays consumers (or producers)

  

1. **Properties of subsidies**
    
    1. who gets the subsidy does not depend on who gets the check
    2. who benefits from the subsidy does depend on relative elasticities
    3. subsidies paid for by taxpayers ‚Üí deadweight loss
    
      
    
2. **Subsidy Wedge**
    
    subsidy = price received by sellers - price paid by buyers
    
    - e.g. subsidy wedge of $1
        
        ![[/Untitled 12.png|Untitled 12.png]]
        
    
      
    
3. **Beneficial Subsidy**
    
    - wage subsidy ‚Üí workers receive more pay, firms keep costs down
