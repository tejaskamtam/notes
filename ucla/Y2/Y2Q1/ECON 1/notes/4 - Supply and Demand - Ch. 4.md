1. price causes movement ALONG the curve
2. law of supply and demand
    1. prices of goods change to bring quantities to equilibrium
3. equilibrium in free markets
    
    1. goods produced at lowest possible cost
    2. goods satisfy highest valued demands

- market
    - a group of buyers and sellers of a good/service
    - buyers
        - determine demand of a product

    - perfectly competitive market
        - all goods are exactly the same
        - so many buyers & sellers that no one affects market price
            - “price taker”
- quantity demanded
    - amount of a good buyers are willing and able to purchase
    - many factors, most notably price
- demand schedule
    
    - a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded of a good

Big Ideas

- supply and demand
    - the forces that make market economies work
    - determine quantity of goods sold
    - determine price at which good sold
- law of demand
    - other things being equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when price rises
- demand curve
    
    - a graph of the relation of price and quantity demanded
    
    ![[/Untitled 4 33.png|Untitled 4 33.png]]
    
- demand shifters
    - note: non-price determinants of demands being equal
    - income
        - normal good
            - increase in income leads to increase in demand
            - e.g. cars, electronics, etc.
        - inferior good
            - increase in income implies decrease in demand
            - e.g. public transport, cup ramen
    - price of substitutes
        - substitutes
            - two goods for which an increase in price of one leads to increase in demand of the other
    - price of complements
        - complements
            - two goods for which an increase in price of one leads to decrease in demand of the other
    - expectations
        - expectations of the future impact demand today
        - if people expect prices to go up in the future or demand to increase in the future, the demand will increase, quantity demanded now increases
    - population
        - more buyers implies more demand
    - tastes
        - a shift in preferences shifts the demand curve in the same direction
- law of supply
    - quantity supplied rises when price rises, other things equal
- supply curve
    
    - a graph of the relationship of price to quantity supplied
    - lower costs increase supply, vice versa

- supply shifters
    - technological innovation
        - technology determines the production cost of output per input required
        - e.g. inventions that decrease time and cost of making goods or performing services
    - input prices
        - price of input includes wages, resources, supplies, etc.
        - if the price of necessary resources increase, the supply shifts down i.e. decreases supply
    - taxes and subsidies
        - subsidies lower costs of production and increase supply
        - tax increases production costs
    - expectations
        - future expectations on profitability can shift the supply curve
    - entry or exit of producers
        - entry of more sellers increases supply
        - decrease of sellers decreases supply
    - changes in opportunity costs
        - if the alternate good increases in value/price, sellers are inclined to supply less of the current good and more of the alternate
        - sellers chase highest profit goods
        - e.g. increase in profitability of SUVs decreases supply of sedans
- equilibrium
    
    - quantity supplied = quantity demanded
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 26.png|Untitled 6 26.png]]
    
- law of supply and demand
    - the price of any good adjusts to bring quantity supplied = quantity demanded
- shift vs movement
    - shift
        - change in supply/demand
    - movement
        - change in quantity demanded/supplied
