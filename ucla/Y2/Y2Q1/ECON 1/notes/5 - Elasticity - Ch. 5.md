## Supplemental Definitions

---

- quantity demanded
    - the amount of a good/service the market is willing to consume at a price point
- quantity supplied
    - the amount of a good/service the market is willing to produce at a price point
- elastic
    - when an increase in price results in disproportionate decrease in quantity demanded and vice-versa
- inelastic
    - when an increase in price results in proportional decrease in quantity demanded
- revenue
    - revenue = Price x Quantity
- normal good
    - $Q_D$Ôªø increases as income increases
- inferior good
    - $Q_D$Ôªø decreases as income increases
- luxury good
    - $Q_D$Ôªø > 0 as income increases
- substitutes
    - increase in price of one increases **demand** of another
- complement
    - increase in price of one decreases **demand** of another

## Big Ideas

### Elasticity

- measures how much one variable responds to changes in another
- i.e. a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded/supplied to its determinants
- generally, the curve of lesser slope is more elastic

### Determinants of the Elasticity of Demand (@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.13.2/katex.min.css')$E_D$Ôªø)

- available substitutes
    - fewer substitutes = inelastic
        - buyers are reluctant to switch goods, thus quantity demanded persists
    - many substitutes = elastic
        - buyers are inclined to switch goods when price is high
- time horizon
    - short run = inelastic
        - buyers have less time to find substitutes, resulting in smaller $Q_D$Ôªø change
    - long run = elastic
        - buyers have more time to find substitutes
- category of product (specific or broad)
    - less specific = inelastic
        - fewer substitutes for specific goods
    - more specific = elastic
        - many substitutes for general goods
- necessities vs. luxuries
    - necessities = inelastic
        - buyers tend to continue to buy necessities at higher prices
    - luxuries = elastic
        - buyers tend to buy less luxuries at higher prices
- purchase size (relative to budget)
    - cheap = inelastic
        - buyers tend to buy more cheap items
    - expensive = elastic
        - buyers tend to buy fewer expensive items

Summary

|**Inelastic**|**Elastic**|
|---|---|
|fewer substitutes|more substitutes|
|short run|long run|
|necessities|luxuries|
|cheap|expensive|

### Determinants of the Elasticity of Supply (@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.13.2/katex.min.css')$E_S$Ôªø)

- per unit costs
    - expensive production = inelastic
    - cheap production = elastic
- time horizon
    - short run = inelastic
        - less time to expand output
    - long run = elastic
        - more time to expand capacity
- share of inputs market
    - large share = inelastic
        - expansion may lead to increased demand (and price) for inputs
    - small share = elastic
        - expansion does not increase price of inputs
- geographic scope
    - wider scope = inelastic
        - more supply chain issues
    - narrow scope
        - easier to distribute

Summary

|Inelastic|Elastic|
|---|---|
|higher cost of production|low cost of production|
|short run|long run|
|large share of market|small share of market|
|global|local|
|raw materials|manufactured goods|

### Price Elasticity (@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.13.2/katex.min.css')$E$Ôªø)

- measure price ($P$Ôªø) sensitivity of $Q$Ôªø

$E_D=\frac {\%\Delta Q} {\%\Delta P}$

- e.g. price elasticity of oil demand
    
    - suppose oil price increases 10%, quantity demanded falls 5% over time, thus long run elasticity of demand:
    
    $‚Åç$
    
      
    
- e.g. elasticity as inverse slope
    
    ![[/Untitled 2 13.png|Untitled 2 13.png]]
    

### Naive Calculation of Elasticity

$E=\frac {\%\Delta Q}{\%P}$

$|E|<1\implies\text{inelastic}\\$

Due to irregularity of percentage changes, we use **Midpoint Method**:

$Q_D,P=\frac{\text{end value}-\text{start value}}{\text{midpoint value}}\times100\%$

- e.g. the problem: elasticity falls as you go ‚Äúup‚Äù the demand curve
    
    ![[/Untitled 3 10.png|Untitled 3 10.png]]
    

### Variations of Elasticity

- Perfectly Inelastic ($E=\frac{0\%}{P\%}=0$Ôªø)
    - vertical demand curve
    - no consumer price sensitivity
    - e.g. demand
        
        ![[/Untitled 4 9.png|Untitled 4 9.png]]
        
    - e.g. supply
        
        ![[/Untitled 5 7.png|Untitled 5 7.png]]
        
- Inelastic ($|E| < 1$Ôªø)
    - relatively steep demand curve
    - low consumer price sensitivity
    - e.g. demand
        
        ![[/Untitled 6 7.png|Untitled 6 7.png]]
        
    - e.g. supply
        
        ![[/Untitled 7 7.png|Untitled 7 7.png]]
        
- Unit Elastic ($|E|=1$Ôªø)
    - proportionately sloped demand curve
    - proportionate consumer price sensitivity
    - e.g. demand
        
        ![[/Untitled 8 7.png|Untitled 8 7.png]]
        
    - e.g. supply
        
        ![[/Untitled 9 6.png|Untitled 9 6.png]]
        
- Elastic ($|E|>1$Ôªø)
    - relatively flat demand curve
    - high consumer price sensitivity
    - e.g. demand
        
        ![[/Untitled 10 4.png|Untitled 10 4.png]]
        
    - e.g. supply
        
        ![[/Untitled 11 3.png|Untitled 11 3.png]]
        
- Perfectly Elastic ($|E|=\infin$Ôªø)
    - horizontal demand curve
    - extreme consumer price sensitivity
    - e.g. demand
        
        ![[/Untitled 12 3.png|Untitled 12 3.png]]
        
    - e.g. supply
        
        ![[/Untitled 13 3.png|Untitled 13 3.png]]
        

### Midpoint Formula for Elasticity

to remove bias from chosen base point, we incorporate the midpoint formula:

$E_=\frac{\frac{Q'-Q}{\frac{Q'+Q}{2}}}{\frac{P'-P}{\frac{P'+P}{2}}}=\frac{(Q'-Q)/[(Q'+Q)/2]}{(P'-P)/[(P'+P)/2]}=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}$

### Revenue Elasticity of Demand

- revenue = price x quantity
- thus, optimizing revenue depends on elasticity
- e.g. visualization of revenue lost
    
    ![[/Untitled 14 2.png|Untitled 14 2.png]]
    
    ![[/Untitled 15 2.png|Untitled 15 2.png]]
    

### Income Elasticity of Demand

measures the response of $Q_D$Ôªø to consumer income:

$E_I=\frac{\%\Delta Q_D}{\%\Delta P}$

$|E_I|>0\implies\text{normal good}\\$

### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

- measures the response of demand for one good due to changes in price of another good:

$E_C=\frac{\%\Delta Q_{D,1}}{\%\Delta P_2}$

$|E_C|>0\implies\text{substitutes}\\$
