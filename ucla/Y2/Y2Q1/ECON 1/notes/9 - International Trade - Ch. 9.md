# Definitions

---

- comparative advantage
    - when one has a lower opportunity cost to produce a good than another

# Big Ideas

---

## World Price and Comparative Advantage

### World Price

- $P_W=$﻿ the “world price” of a good
    
      
    
- the price that prevails in world markets

### Domestic Price

- $P_D=$﻿ the domestic price of a good without trade

### Comparative advantage

- $P_D\lt P_W$﻿
    - country has a comparative advantage → exports good
- $P_D>P_W$﻿
    - no comparative advantage → imports good

## Small Economy Assumption

### Small Economy

- a small economy is a price taker in world markets → it’s actions have no effect on world price
- not always true → large players like US, China, Russia, etc. → used to simplify
- no buyer buys for > world price → no seller sells < world price
- e.g. soybean exports

- e.g. soybean surpluses

### Welfare effects of trade

- e.g. chart
    
    ![[/Untitled 2 21.png|Untitled 2 21.png]]
    
- consumers enjoy increased variety of goods
- producers sell to larger markets → low costs and larger scale
- competition reduces monopolization

## Trade Barriers

### Opposition to trade (Losers)

- losers of trade are highly concentrated → lobbying for restrictions
- winners experience gains spread thinly across many entities

### Tariffs

- tariff - a tax on imports
- $\implies P_D=P_W+T$﻿
- overproduction + underconsumption → imposes deadweight loss
- → increased domestic supply
- → decreased domestic demand
- e.g. free trade
    
    ![[/Untitled 3 17.png|Untitled 3 17.png]]
    
- e.g. tariff shifts
    
    ![[/Untitled 4 16.png|Untitled 4 16.png]]
    
- e.g. deadweight loss

### Costs of Protectionism

- protectionism - policy of restraining trade through quotas, tariffs, and other regulations which burden foreign producers → aim to help domestic producers
- in regards to tariffs:
- increased domestic production + decreased domestic consumption
- less consumption → less gains from trade
- e.g. wasted resources
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 14.png|Untitled 6 14.png]]
    
- e.g. wasted resources computation
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 14.png|Untitled 7 14.png]]
    
- lobbying - loss to consumers > gains to producers (domestic)

### Quotas

- import quota - a limit on imports of a good
- similar effects to tariffs: reduces buyer welfare, increases seller welfare
- creates profits for foreign exporters → sell at a higher price bc of quota

## Criticism of Trade

### Common Arguments

- Reduced domestic jobs
- Ethicality of trade with countries with immoral practices
- National security
- Benefits of spillover of “key industries” to others
- Increase US well-being with trade protectionism

### Jobs Argument

- Issues:
    - destroys jobs in the industry competing with imports
    - consumers have less money to spend on other goods
    - jobs lost in complementary industries
- Response:
    - total unemployment unchanged → jobs lost in imports are gained in exports
    - countries only require comparative advantages to benefit from trade (cheaper production across the board is irrelevant)
    - money spent on imports are usually used to buy our exports → creates jobs in exports
- e.g. unemployment to imports

### National Security Arg

- true to a point → must enforce realistic expectations of the importance of securities
- producers tend to exaggerate national importance to reduce competition

### Unfair-Competition Arg

- critics claim importers have unfair advantages through subsidies, policies, etc.
- → gains to consumers > losses to producers

### Child Labor Arg

- restricting trade may do more harm → alternative to no opportunity is poverty
- child labor is a poverty issue not trade issue

### Bargaining Chip Arg

- the counterfactual of losing a threat is reducing welfare across the board
- can also hurt credibility
