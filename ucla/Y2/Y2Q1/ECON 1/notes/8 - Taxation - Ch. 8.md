# Definitions

---

- tax
    - a fee imposed by a government to collect revenue on the sale of a good in a market
    - drives a wedge between the price buyers pay and price sellers receive
    - reduces market quantity

## Effects of Tax

### Revenue

- e.g. revenue graph

### Welfare Economics

- [[Efficiency of Markets - Ch. 7]]
- e.g. surpluses

- a tax imposes deadweight loss between $Q_T$﻿ nd $Q_E$﻿
- tax revenue = $T\cdot Q_T\space |\space T=P_B-P_A$﻿
- the quantity that encompasses the deadweight loss (DWL) represents unsold goods due to the tax

### Price elasticity

- [[Elasticity - Ch. 5]]
- the elasticity of Demand and Supply determines whether consumers or producers burden the wight of the tax
- Supply (due to tax)
    - when supply is inelastic (large slope) → harder for sellers to leave the market when $P_S$﻿ **falls**
    - when supply is elastic → easier for sellers too leave when $P_S$﻿ **falls** → greater DWL
- Demand (due to tax)
    - when demand is inelastic → harder for buyers to leave when $P_B$﻿ **rises**
    - when demand is elastic → easier for buyers to leave when $P_B$﻿ **rises** → greater DWL

## Effect of Government

### Size of Government

- larger govts → more revenue → higher tax → greater DWL
- ex. tax on labor income
- → the marginal tax rate is ~40% → DWL depends on labor elasticity

### Elasticity

- some economists believe the DWL of high tax is low → labor supply is inelastic → assumes people will keep their job regardless of wage
- others believe labor supply is elastic in certain domains → part-time, overtime, retirement, “under-the-table” jobs

## Size of Tax

### Correlation of Tax Size to DWL

- the total DWL is based on the area “under the curve”
- → an increase in tax exponentially (squared) increases DWL
- e.g. correlation

- this tells that increasing/decreasing large taxes has a significant impact on DWL

### Correlation of Tax Size and Revenue

- a small revenue from tax benefits largely from increases in tax
- vice-versa for large taxes → increasing tax has a nominal effect on revenue
- e.g. large taxes

### Laffer Curve

- shows the relationship of the size of tax and tax revenue → parabolic
- e.g. laffer curve
