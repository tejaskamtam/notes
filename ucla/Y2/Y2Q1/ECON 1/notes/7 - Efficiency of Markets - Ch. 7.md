## Willingness to Pay (WTP)

- the maximum amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good/service

### Demand curve effects

- $Q_D=$Ôªø # of people able to purchase based on their WTP (at a price point $P$Ôªø)
- e.g. demand schedule

- e.g. demand curve

### Marginal buyer

- a large # of buyers ‚Äúsmooths‚Äù out the staircase in a demand ‚Äúcurve‚Äù
- the height of the demand curve at a ‚Äústep‚Äù is the WTP of the marginal buyer
- marginal buyer - the buyer who would leave the market at the price point of the ‚Äústep‚Äù

  

## Consumer Surplus

- Consumer Surplus: $\text{CS}=\text{WTP}-P$Ôªø
- the area under the Demand curve above the price point
- e.g. demand curve

### Smooth demand curve

- CS = area of the triangle formed below $D$Ôªø and above $P$Ôªø
- e.g. smooth demand curve

- e.g. changes in price point ‚Üí changes in CS (area)

## Cost

- the value of everything the seller must give up to produce a good (opportunity cost)
- includes COGS and value of seller‚Äôs time

### Demand curve effects

- $Q_S$Ôªø = # of sellers willing to sell at a price point
- e.g. supply curve ‚Äústepped‚Äù
    
    ![[/Untitled 5 5.png|Untitled 5 5.png]]
    

### Marginal seller

- height of each step is the cost of the marginal seller
- marginal seller - the seller who would leave the market if price point was ‚â§

## Producer Surplus

- $\text{PS}=P-\text{cost}$Ôªø
- the area above the supply curve and below the price point
- e.g. stepped supply curve
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 5.png|Untitled 6 5.png]]
    

### Smooth supply curve

- PS = area of triangle formed above $S$Ôªø and below $P$Ôªø
- e.g. changes in $P$Ôªø ‚Üí changes in area
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 5.png|Untitled 7 5.png]]
    

## Total Surplus

- CS = value to buyers - amount paid = buyers‚Äô gain from market
- PS = amount received - cost to sellers = sellers‚Äô gain from market
- a measure of society‚Äôs well-being

### Total Surplus

- TS = CS + PS = total gain from trade in a market = value to buyers - cost to sellers
- e.g. total surplus

## Efficiency

### Market Allocation

- to answer whether the market‚Äôs decentralized allocation of resources is desirable
- is the market efficient? (policy makers also consider equality)

### Efficiency

- market allocation is efficient if it maximizes total surplus
    - goods are consumed by buyers who value them most
    - goods are produced by producers with the lowest costs
    - changing quantity will not change (increase) total surplus
- market equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets achieves efficiency
- e.g. efficient market ‚Üí at equilibrium
    
    ![[/Untitled 9 4.png|Untitled 9 4.png]]
    

## Free Market

- a centralized market allocation would require knowledge of every cost and WTP of every good in the society ‚Üí impossible
- market equilibrium is efficient ‚Üí no higher total surplus
- _Laissez faire_ (‚Äùallow them to do‚Äù) - implies government should not intervene with the market
