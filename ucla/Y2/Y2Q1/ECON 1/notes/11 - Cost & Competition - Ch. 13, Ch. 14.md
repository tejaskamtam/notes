## Costs

### Explicit vs Implicit Cost

- explicit costs
    - require an outlay oof money
    - e.g. wages
- implicit costs
    - other than cash outlay
    - e.g. OC of owner’s time

### Economic vs Accounting Profit

- accounting profit
    - totaal revenue - explicit costs
- economic profit
    - total revenue - total costs

### Fixed vs Variable vs Total Cost

- fixed cost (FC)
    - do not vary with quantity of output produced
- variable cost (VC)
    - cost varies with quantity produced
- total cost (TC)
    - TC = FC + VC

## Production Function

- a graph of the relationship between the quantity of inputs use to produce a good and the quantity of output of the good
- inputs can be considered as labor (workers and/or hours)
- outputs can be considered as quantity produced
- e.g. farmer jack

### Marginal Product

- the increase in output due to additional units of input, holding all other inputs constant
- denoted $\Delta$﻿
- Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) denotes the slope of the labor-quantity production function
    
    ![[/Untitled 1 15.png|Untitled 1 15.png]]
    
- $MPL=\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$﻿
- e.g. farmer jack
    
    ![[/Untitled 2 14.png|Untitled 2 14.png]]
    

### Diminishing Marginal Product

- the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of input increases
- MPL has diminishing returns on the basis of inputs
- i.e. the slope of the product function decreases as inputs increase

### Marginal Cost (MC)

- the increase in Total Cost (TC) from producing an additional unit
- $MC=\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$﻿
- e.g. farmer jack
    
    ![[/Untitled 3 11.png|Untitled 3 11.png]]
    
- MC tends to increase as quantity of product increases

  

## Cost Curves

- e.g. FC vs VC vs TC
    
    ![[/Untitled 4 10.png|Untitled 4 10.png]]
    
- e.g. Marginal Cost
    
    ![[/Untitled 5 8.png|Untitled 5 8.png]]
    
- e.g. average fixed cost (AFC)
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 8.png|Untitled 6 8.png]]
    
- e.g. average variable cost (AVC)
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 8.png|Untitled 7 8.png]]
    
- e.g. average total cost (ATC): U-shaped
    
    - ATC =AFC + AVC
    - ATC = TC/Q
    
    ![[/Untitled 8 8.png|Untitled 8 8.png]]
    
- All
    
    ![[/Untitled 9 7.png|Untitled 9 7.png]]
    

### Relationships

- MC < ATC $\implies$﻿ATC is falling
- MC > ATC $\implies$﻿ ATC is rising
- MC = ATC $\implies$﻿ ATC is at minimum

### Short and Long Run

- short run
    - some inputs fixed (factories, land) $\implies$﻿ FC
    - e.g. ATC by factory size
        
        ![[/Untitled 10 5.png|Untitled 10 5.png]]
        
- long run
    - all inputs are variable (buy more land/factories) $\implies$﻿ VC
    - e.g. ATC
        
        ![[/Untitled 11 4.png|Untitled 11 4.png]]
        

  

### ATC and Scale

- Economies of scale - when increasing production allows more specialization → increases efficiency
    - occurs when Q output is low (early ATC)
- Diseconomies of scale - due to uncoordinated management → stretches management thin
    - occurs when Q output is high (late ATC)

## Profit Maximization

### Perfect competition

- large/dense market
- goods offered are similar in quality
- producer entry cost is low
- $\implies$﻿ buyers and sellers are “price takers” (take price as given)

### Revenue

- total revenue (TR)
    - $TR=P\times Q$﻿
- average revenue (AR)
    - $AR=\frac{TR}{Q}=P$﻿
    - because market makers are price takers
- marginal revenue (MR)
    - $MR=\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$﻿
- perfect competition characterized by $MR=P$﻿ (price takers)

### Profit Maximization

- MR > MC = increase Q output to increase profit
- MR < MC = reduce Q output to increase profit
- e.g. table
    
    ![[/Untitled 12 4.png|Untitled 12 4.png]]
    
- e.g. graph
    
    ![[/Untitled 13 4.png|Untitled 13 4.png]]
    

### Shutdown vs Exit

- sunk costs
    - costs that have been committed and cant be recovered
- shutdown
    - short-run (SR) decision to halt production due to market conditions
    - FC cost remains
    - when $TR\lt VC$﻿
    - when $P < AVC$﻿
- exit
    - long-run (LR) decision to leave market
    - zero costs remain
- e.g. visual
    
    ![[/Untitled 14 3.png|Untitled 14 3.png]]
    

### Long Run Decisions

- P < ATC
    - a firm will exit the market
- P > ATC
    - a firm will enter the market

### Profit Maximization

- Identifying LR profit
    
    ![[/Untitled 15 3.png|Untitled 15 3.png]]
    
- identifying LR loss
    
    ![[/Untitled 16 2.png|Untitled 16 2.png]]
    

## Supply Curve

### SR Market Supply

![[/Untitled 17 2.png|Untitled 17 2.png]]

- LR - firms can enter and exit the market
    - economic profit is positive: SR Supply shifts right
    - economic profit is negative: SR supply shifts left

### Zero Profit Condition

- long-run equilibrium - process of entry/exit is completed → remaining firms earn 0 economic profit
- when $P=MC=ATC$﻿ i.e. minimum ATC
- firms produce at $P=MR=MC$﻿
- then, firms stay in the market for a positive accounting profit
- e.g. zero-profit condition
    
    ![[/Untitled 18 2.png|Untitled 18 2.png]]
    
- e.g. causal relationship of LR and SR S/D
    
    ![[/Untitled 19 2.png|Untitled 19 2.png]]
    
- $\implies$﻿ LR supply slopes upward when assumptions are not met
    - all firms have identical costs
        - $\implies$﻿ if P = ATC for one firm → profit = 0, a low cost firm has profit > 0
    - costs do not change as other firms enter/exit
        - not always true in real life

## Profit Maximization Summary

- profit maximized when $MC=MR$﻿
- perfect competition when $P=MR$﻿
- in competitive equilibrium $P=MC$﻿
