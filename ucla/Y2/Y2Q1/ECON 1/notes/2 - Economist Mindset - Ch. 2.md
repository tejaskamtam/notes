# Recall

1. Circular Flow Diagram
    1. shows the flow of goods/services, factors of production, and money
    2. using resources, wages, labor, income, etc.
2. PPF
    1. describes a country‚Äôs production possibilities for given unit resources
    2. trade makes countries achieve higher than possible output
3. Specialization
    1. specialization creates a comparative advantage in total production through trade

  

# Notes

Supplemental Definitions

- model
    - highly simplified representation of a complex reality
- capital
    - buildings and machines used in production
- factors of production
    - resources the economy uses to produce goods/services
    - capital, land, labor
- households
    - own factors of production and sell to firms
    - consume goods/services
- firms
    - own goods/services and hire/buy factors of production
    - sell goods/services
- absolute advantage
    - ability to produce a good using fewer factors of production than another producer
    - measures a cost of good in terms of inputs require to produce
- comparative advantage
    - ability to produce goods at a lower opportunity cost than other producers
    - measures the cost of a good in terms of opportunity cost
- positive statements
    - a testable statement, may not be true
- normative statements
    - an opinion, usually describes the way things ‚Äúshould‚Äù be
- subsidize
    - to pay for or cover the cost of
    - e.g. the US subsidizes oil and agriculture
- effluent tax
    - tax paid for discharge of pollutants/waste of production into the environment

Big Ideas

- economists‚Äô roles
    - scientists
        - explain the economy
        - use the scientific method to describe the economy
    - policy advisors
        - improve economy
- assumptions ‚Üí models
    - to study comparably, make assumptions and portray in models
- circular-flow diagram
    
    - model of the economy shows how money flows through markets, households, and firms
    - describes 2 markets: goods/services and factors of production
    - lacks representation of government impact, other markets (international, financial, etc.)

- Production Possibilities Frontier
    - a graph that represents the combinations of two goods an economy can produce given limited resources/tech
    - considers this combination in trade (usually among countries)
    - PPF efficiency
        
        - efficient = along PPF
        - inefficient = below PPF
        - unattainable = above PPF
        
        ![[/Untitled 1 55.png|Untitled 1 55.png]]
        
    - trade
        
        - trade can make unattainable PPF efficiency attainable
        - trade benefits both countries by making total output higher per unit resources consumed
        - specialization increases comparative advantage using trade
        
        ![[/Untitled 2 48.png|Untitled 2 48.png]]
        
    - opportunity cost
        - slope of the PPF
        - constant OC means a linear PPF
        - changing opportunity costs can cause a ‚Äúbowed‚Äù PPF
    - shifts of PPF
        - economic growth shifts PPF up (outward)
- economists as policy advisors
    - economists as scientists make positive statements to describe the economy
    - as policy makers, economists make normative statements to prescribe how the economy should be
- commonly agreed propositions
    - rent caps reduce quantity/quality of housing available
    - tariffs reduce general economic welfare
    - US shouldn‚Äôt restrict outsourcing of work from foreign nations
    - US should eliminate agriculture subsidies
    - gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainable with current policy
    - large federal budget deficits have an adverse effect on the economy
    - minimum wage increases unemployment among unskilled workers
    - effluent taxes and marketable pollution permits are a better approach to pollution control than pollution ceiling policies

**SUMMARY  
**Economists as scientists try to explain the economy using testable theories and the scientific method. Some of these explanations are visualized with models: the circular flow diagram represents the flow of goods/service, factors of production, and money used to purchase/hire; the PPF represents a producers efficient utilization of resources to produce (limited to 2 goods) and reflects the benefit of trade and specialization.
