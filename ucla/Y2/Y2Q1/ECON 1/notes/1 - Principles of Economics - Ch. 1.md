# Recall

    1. handling scarcity (through economic activity due to incentives)
2. Market Economy
    1. allocates resources through individual decisions of many people/firms through interaction in markets
3. Society‚Äôs Tradeoff
    1. efficiency vs. equality
    2. maximizing profits vs distributing prosperity
4. Trade
    1. specialization induces trade which increases benefit for a similar cost
5. Economic growth
    1. productivity determines a country‚Äôs standard of living
6. Governments
    1. institutions regulate policy to prevent market failure and motivate productivity
7. Volatility
    1. economic volatility is regulated by fiscal and monetary policy
8. Inflation
    1. regulation of money supply (printing more) can lead to loss of money‚Äôs value
9. Central banking
    
    1. the Fed regulates money supply to stabilize the economy

Supplemental Definitions

- scarcity
    
    - limited nature of society‚Äôs resources
    
    - how people decide to buy, work, save, spend
    - how firms decide to produce, hire, sell
    - how societies decide to allocate resources
- economics
    - study of how society manages its scarce resources
- efficiency
    - when society gets the most from scarce resources
- equality
    - when prosperity is distributed uniformly among society‚Äôs members
- equity
    - equality allocated proportionally with need/circumstances
- opportunity cost
    - the (lost) benefit of the alternative choice
- the margin
    - ‚Äúthe current level‚Äù
- productivity
    - ability to produce goods and service
    - amount of goods/services produced per unit of labor
    - depends on equipment, skills, and tech available
- market failure
    - when a market fails to allocate society‚Äôs resources effectively
    - causes
        - externalities
            - e.g. effects of pollution, global warming
        - market power
            - e.g. monopoly, extreme control

    - the use of government revenue collection (taxation) and expenditures (spending) to moderate economy
- monetary policy
    - government use of the supply of money (targeting interest rates) to promote economic stability/growth
- inflation
    - increase in the general level of prices
- ‚Äúthe Fed‚Äù
    - the federal reserve is the U.S.‚Äô central bank

Big Ideas

- incentives matter
    - something that induces action, e.g. prospect of reward/punishment
    - rational people respond to incentives, in predictable ways
    - self-interest (incentive) drives economics
- markets organize economic activity
    - a group of buyers and sellers - a good way to organize economic activity
    - ‚Äúorganizing economic activity‚Äù
        - what/how/how much/who ‚Äúto produce‚Äù
    - Adam Smith in _The Wealth of Nations_
        - each deciding entity in a market economy is ‚Äúled by an invisible hand‚Äù (incentives)
        - interaction of buyers and sellers determines ‚Äúfair market price‚Äù which reflects the good‚Äôs value to buyers
        - prices guide self-interested individuals to make decisions that maximize society‚Äôs economic well being
- people face tradeoffs
    - making decisions requires comparing costs/benefits of alternative choices
    - increasing equality distributes wealth/resources but reduces incentive to work, thus shrinking economic activity
- rational people think at the margin
    - people purposefully make decisions to best achieve their objectives by evaluating costs/benefits of marginal changes
    - e.g. business owner considers benefit of increased output/revenue from hiring to cost of labor/extra resources
- the power of trade
    
    - trade can make everyone better off
    - people can specialize rather than being self-sufficient by exchanging goods
    
      
    
- importance of economic growth (wealth)
    - a country‚Äôs standard of living depends on its productivity
- importance of institutions
    
    - the importance of government is to enforce property rights
        - people are less likely to work/produce if there is a large risk of losing property
    - institutions try to prevent market failure by dealing with externalities and preventing market power to promote equity
    - public policy may promote efficiency
    
      
    
- economic booms/bursts are inevitable
    - booms/bursts cannot be avoided but can be moderated
    - governments‚Äô policy maker use fiscal policy and monetary policy to ‚Äúsmooth out‚Äù economic volatility
    - economic volatility is usually due to market failure, solved by public policy
- prices rise when govts. print more money
    - inflation
    - in the long run, inflation is caused by excessive growth in the quantity of money which leads to loss of value
    - the faster money s created, the greater the inflation rate
- central banking is complex
    - in the short run, society faces a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
        - in the short run (1-2 years), economic policies often push inflation and unemployment inversely
    - other factors can make this tradeoff more/less favorable
    - the fed regulates the money supply to maintain economic stability

**SUMMARY  
**Economics is about how a society handles scarcity in resources, people, time, etc. A society develops a market economy to facilitate trade in which members are involved due to incentives most notably self-interest.  
Markets encourage trade in which individuals specialize in production of unique goods to decrease the tradeoffs of self-subsistence for all goods.  
Governments regulate public policy to prevent market failure and promote economic growth. The central bank (Fed) is in charge of the money supply and utilizes fiscal and monetary policy to regulate the economy. Consequently, monetary policy may cause inflation and conversely impact unemployment
