## Definitions

### Planar graph

- a graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without crossing edges
- e.g. planar graph

### Cycle graph

- the cycle graph $C_n$ï»¿ has $|V(C_n)|=n$ï»¿ vertices is the simple, connected graph consisting of a single cycle
- every vertex has degree 2
- is a planar graph
- e.g. planar (cycle) graph

### Faces

- for a connected planar graph, the edges $E(G)$ï»¿ divide the plane into regions called faces
- each face is defined by the cycle that forms its boundary (including the graph itself)
- e.g. faces of $G=K_4$ï»¿

## Euler Theorem

- for connected planar graph $G$ï»¿ with $f$ï»¿ faces and $v=|V(G)|,e=|E(G)|$ï»¿
- $\implies f=e-v+2$ï»¿
- therefore, if $G$ï»¿ does not follow the theorem, then it is not planar
- e.g. $K_{3,3}$ï»¿
    
    ![[/Untitled 3 13.png|Untitled 3 13.png]]
    
- e.g. $K_5$ï»¿

## Series Reduction

### Series Reduction

- $\exists v\in V(G)\space :\space \delta(v)=2\space|\space v_1,v_2\in V\space :\space v_1\neq v_2\space |\space (v_1,v),(v_2,v)\in V(G)$ï»¿
- $\implies$ï»¿ edges $(v_1,v),(v_2,v)$ï»¿ are in series
- Then, a series reduction forms a graph $G'\space|\space V(G')=V(G)-\{v\}\space,\space E(G')=E(G)-\{(v_1,v),(v_2,v)\}\cup\{(v_1,v_2)\}$ï»¿
- then, $G'$ï»¿ is obtained from $G$ï»¿ by a series reduction
- e.g. $K_{3,3}$ï»¿

### Homeomorphic

- graphs $G_1,G_2$ï»¿ are homeomorphic if $G_1+G_2$ï»¿ can be reduced to isomorphic graphs by applying a sequence of series reductions
- e.g. $K_{3,3}$ï»¿
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 10.png|Untitled 6 10.png]]
    
- e.g. relation
    
    ![[/Untitled 7 10.png|Untitled 7 10.png]]
    

## Kuratowski Theorem

- a graph is planar $\iff$ï»¿ it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to $K_5$ï»¿ or $K_{3,3}$ï»¿
- e.g. not planar by $K_{3,3}$ï»¿
