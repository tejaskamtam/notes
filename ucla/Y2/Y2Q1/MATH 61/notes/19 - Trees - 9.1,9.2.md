## Trees

### Tree

- a tree is a simple graph with the property that if $v,w\in V(T)\implies\exists$ï»¿ a (unique) simple path $v\to w$ï»¿
- trees are acyclic

### Rooted Tree

- a tree with some vertex defined as the root (any vertex can be a root)
- e.g. rooted tree

### Level

- the level of a vertex is the length of the simple path from the root to the vertex (in aa rooted tree)

### Height

- the height of a rooted tree is the maximal level that can appear as the level of one of its vertices
- e.g.

### Theorem

- every tree of â‰¥ 2 vertices has a vertex of degree 1 (leaf nodes)
- e.g. proof

### Bipartite

- based on the

### Subtrees

- e.g. Kronos

### Proposition

- a graph is a tree IF it is acyclic and connected

## Misc Definitions

## Theorem

- let $T$ï»¿ be a graph where $|V(T)|=n$ï»¿, then
- $T$ï»¿ is a tree, connected, acyclic, and $|E(T)|=n-1$ï»¿
