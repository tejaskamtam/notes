# Definitions

---

- simple graph
    - a graph with no parallel edges or loops
- incident edge
    - an edge that connects to a vertex = the incident edge to the vertex

## Adjacency Matrix

- an $n\times n$ï»¿ matrix $A$ï»¿ where $|V(G)|=n$ï»¿ with rows and columns labeled by ordered vertices of graph $G$ï»¿
- the entry at $i,j$ï»¿ records the number of edges between the ith and jth vertices
- a loop is counted as 2 edges
- e.g. adjacency matrix

### Symmetry

- adjacency is a symmetric condition $\implies$ï»¿the adjacency matrix is symmetric

### Powers of $A$ï»¿

- if $A$ï»¿ is the adjacency matrix of a simple graph
- the $ij$ï»¿th entry of $A^n=$ï»¿ the number of paths from vertex $i$ï»¿ to vertex $j$ï»¿ of length $n$ï»¿ for $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ï»¿
- e.g. paths due to powers of $A$ï»¿

## Incidence Matrix

- a matrix with rows labeled by $v\in V(G)$ï»¿ and columns labeled by $e\in E(G)$ï»¿
- store a 1 in $A_{ve}$ï»¿ is edge $e$ï»¿ is incident to $v$ï»¿, else â†’ 0
- e.g. incident matrix
