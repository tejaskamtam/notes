Supplemental Definitions

Examples

- e.g. multiplication principle
    - whatâ€™s the number of strings of length 4 from ABCDE with no repetition
    - $n_1=5,n_2=4,n_3=3,n_4=2$ï»¿
    - $\prod_{k=1}^4 n_k=5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2$ï»¿ strings
    - no need to expand
    - e.g. how many of those strings start w/ B
        - $n_1=1,n_2=4,n_3=3,n_4=2$ï»¿
        - $\prod_{k=1}^4 n_k=1\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2$ï»¿ strings
- e.g. multiplication principle proof
    - prove $|X|=n\implies |P(X)|=2^n$ï»¿
    - consider the number of ways to build $S\in P(X)$ï»¿
    - for each $x\in X$ï»¿ we decide
        - add x to S or
        - not add x to S
        - i.e. 2 choices for each element x
    - therefore there are n steps
    - $\implies 2_1\cdot2_2\cdot...\cdot2_n=2^n$ï»¿
    - by the Multiplication Principle
- e.g. multiplication principle
    - suppose you must choose 2 movies from distinct genres: 3 romance, 4 comedy, 5 childrenâ€™s
    - how many ways to choose 2 movies
    - $X_1=\{\text{romance+comedy}\}$ï»¿
    - $X_2=\{\text{romance+children}\}$ï»¿
    - $X_3=\{\text{comedy+children}\}$ï»¿
    - Multiplication Principle
        - $|X_1|=3\cdot4$ï»¿
        - $|X_2|=3\cdot5$ï»¿
        - $|X_3|=4\cdot5$ï»¿
    - by the addition principle, because $X_1,X_2,X_3$ï»¿ are disjoint:
        - $\implies3\cdot4+3\cdot5+4\cdot5$ï»¿
- e.g. inclusion-exclusion principle
    - you have a committee of members A,B,C,D,E,F
    - from this committee choose a unique president, secretary, and treasurer
    - what is the total # of ways to choose
        - $n_1=6,n_2=5,n_3=4$ï»¿
        - $\implies 6\cdot5\cdot4$ï»¿ ways by the multiplication principle
    - what if A or B must be president
        - $n_1=2,n_2=5,n_3=4$ï»¿
        - $\implies 2\cdot5\cdot4$ï»¿ ways by the multiplication principle
    - what if A or D or both to be officers
        - $X=\{\text{A on board}\}$ï»¿
        - $Y=\{\text{D on board}\}$ï»¿
        - $|X\cup Y|$ï»¿ is desired count
        - by the inclusion-exclusion principle $\implies |X|+|Y|-|X\cap Y|$ï»¿

Big Ideas

- multiplication principle
    - if an event can be broken down into t independent steps
    - where there are n ways to do step 1, n2 ways to do step 2, â€¦
    - then, there are $n_1\cdot n_2 \cdot...n_t$ï»¿ possible events
- addition principle
    - suppose $X_1,â€¦,X_t$ï»¿ are sets where $|X_i|=n_i$ï»¿
    - if each set $X_i,X_j$ï»¿ are disjoint when $i\neq j$ï»¿
    - the number of elements that can be chosen from $X_1$ï»¿ or $X_2$ï»¿ or â€¦ or $X_t$ï»¿ is:
    - $\sum_{k=1}^t n_k=n_1+...+n_t$ï»¿
- inclusion-exclusion principle
    
    - if $X,Y$ï»¿ are finite sets
    - $|X\cup Y|=|X|+|Y|-|X\cap Y|$ï»¿
