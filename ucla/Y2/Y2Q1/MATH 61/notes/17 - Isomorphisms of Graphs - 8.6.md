# Definitions

---

- visualizations of graphs
    - we can visualize graphs in multiple ways
    - e.g. isomorphic representation
        
        ![[/Untitled 17.png|Untitled 17.png]]
        
- injective function
    - a function that is ‚Äúone-to-one‚Äù
    - it maps every value of the domain to a single value in the codomain
    - $f:X\to Y$Ôªø is injective $\iff f(x)=f(y)\implies x=y\space |\space x\in X,y\in Y$Ôªø
- surjective function
    - a function that is ‚Äúonto‚Äù
    - $f:X\to Y$Ôªø is surjective $\iff \forall y\in Y,\exists x\in X\space |\space f(x)=y$Ôªø
- bijective function
    - a function that is both injective and surjective
- equivalence relation
    - a relation which is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric
- simple cycle
    - a path $a\to a$Ôªø for $a\in V(G)$Ôªø such that no edge is crossed more than once

# Big Ideas

---

## Isomorphism

- graphs $G_1,G_2$Ôªø are isomorphic if there is are bijective functions:
    - $f:V(G_1)\to V(G_2)$Ôªø
    - $g:E(G_1)\to E(G_2)$Ôªø
    - s.t. $\exists e=(v\in V(G_1),w\in V(G_1)\iff g(e)=(f(v),f(w))$Ôªø
- this pair of functions $f,g$Ôªø is an isomorphism of $G_1$Ôªø onto $G_2$Ôªø

### Relations

- a relation $R$Ôªø on the set of graphs s.t. $G_1RG_2$Ôªø when $G_1,G_2$Ôªø are isomorphic
- this is an equivalence relation

### Theorem

- $G_1,G_2$Ôªø are isomorphic $\iff$Ôªø for some ordering of their vertices, their adjacency matrices are equal
- e.g. isomorphism of adjacency matrices

### Corollary

- let $G_1,G_2$Ôªø be simple graphs, then $G_1,G_2$Ôªø are isomorphic if:
- $\exists f:V(G_1)\longmapsto V(G_2)$Ôªø s.t. $v,w$Ôªø are adjacent in $G_1\iff f(v),f(w)$Ôªø are adjacent in $G_2$Ôªø

## Invariants

- a property of graphs that is preserved under isomorphism
- property $P$Ôªø is an invariant when $G_1$Ôªø has property $P$Ôªø s.t. $G\in [G_1]$Ôªø has property $P$Ôªø

### Proving Not Isomorphic

- detect discrepancies in invariants of graphs
- e.g. vertices, edges
    
    ![[/Untitled 2 7.png|Untitled 2 7.png]]
    
- e.g. degree
    
    ![[/Untitled 3 4.png|Untitled 3 4.png]]
    

### Proposition

- the property of having a simple cycle of length $k$Ôªø is an invariant
