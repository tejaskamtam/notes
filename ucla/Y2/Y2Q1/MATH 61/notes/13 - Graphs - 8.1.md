## Definitions

---

- vertices
    - a point at which edges meet
- edge
    - a line/path between vertices
- digraph
    - a directed graph
- path
    - the edges/vertices to cross to get from some point A to some point B on a graph

## Big Ideas

---

### Graphs

- A graph $G$ï»¿ is a set of vertices $V(G)$ï»¿ and edges $E(G)\sube\{(u,v)|u,v\in V\}$ï»¿
- $(u,v)=e\in E(G)$ï»¿ is an unordered pair $\therefore (u,v)=(v,u)$ï»¿
- e.g. digraph

### Directed graph (digraph)

- A directed graph G is a set of vertices $V(G)$ï»¿ and edges $E(G)\sube \{(u,v)|u,v\in V\}\sube V\times X$ï»¿
- Where $(u,v)=e\in E(G)$ï»¿ is an ordered pair

### Edges

- an edge $e\in E(G)$ï»¿ is incident to vertices $v,w$ï»¿ if $e=(v,w)$ï»¿
- $\implies v,w$ï»¿ are adjacent vertices
- e.g. adjacent edges

### Multiple edges

- multiple edges associated to the pair of vertices $\{v,w\}\in V$ï»¿ are called parallel edges
- an edge $(v,v)$ï»¿ s.t. $v\in V$ï»¿ is called a loop
- If vertex $v$ï»¿ is not adjacent to any other vertex in $V(G)$ï»¿, then $v$ï»¿ is isolated

### Simple graph

- if $G$ï»¿ has no parallel edges or loops, $G$ï»¿ is a simple graph

### Weighted graph

- a graph with numbers associated to edges is a weighted graph
- if edge $e\in E$ï»¿ has label $k$ï»¿, then the weight of edge $e$ï»¿ is $k$ï»¿
- for a path $P$ï»¿ in a weighted graph, the length of $P$ï»¿ is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path

### Complete Graph

- the complete graph on $n$ï»¿ vertices (denoted $K_n$ï»¿) is the simple graph s.t. $|V(K_n)|=n$ï»¿ and an edge between each pair of vertices
- Hamiltonian when $n\ge 3$ï»¿
- e.g. $K_4$ï»¿

### Bipartite graph

- graph $G=(V,E)$ï»¿ is bipartite if there exists sets of vertices $V_1, V_2 \sube V$ï»¿ (possibly empty) where $V_1\cap V_2=\phi$ï»¿ (mutually exclusive) and $V_1\cup V_2 = V$ï»¿ (partition)
- and each edge $e\in E$ï»¿ exists s.t. $e=(v_1,v_2)$ï»¿ for $v_1\in V_1,\space v_2\in V_2$ï»¿
- e.g. bipartite graph

### Complete bipartite graph

- the complete bipartite graph $G$ï»¿ on $m$ï»¿ and $n$ï»¿ vertices (denoted $K_{m,n}$ï»¿) is the simple graph where vertex sets $V_1,V_2$ï»¿ partition $V(G)$ï»¿ where $|V_1|=m,\space |V_2|=n$ï»¿
- and $E(K_{m,n})=\{(v_1,v_2)\space|\space v_1\in V_1,\space v_2\in V_2\}$ï»¿
- Hamiltonian when $m=n\ge2$ï»¿
- e.g. $K_{3,2}$ï»¿
    
    ![[/Untitled 4 28.png|Untitled 4 28.png]]
    

### Degree Sum Formula

- if graph $G$ï»¿ has $m$ï»¿ edges and vertices $V=\{v_1,..,v_n\}$ï»¿
- $\sum_{i=1}^n \delta(v_i)=2m$ï»¿
