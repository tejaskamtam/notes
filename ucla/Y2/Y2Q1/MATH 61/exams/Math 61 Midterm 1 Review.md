Supplemental Definitions

- vacuously
    - a statement of Pâ†’Q is true if P is false

Example Problems

- Relations
    - $X=\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ï»¿ R on X s.t. $R=\{(2n,2n+1)|n\in\mathbb Z\}$ï»¿
    - show antisymmetric? transitive?
        - antisymmetric
            - R is antisymmetric if when xRy and yRx, x=y for x,y $\in$ï»¿ X
            - (x,y) $\in$ï»¿ R if x is even, and y is odd, so (y,x) $\notin$ï»¿ R
            - $\therefore$ï»¿ R is antisymmetric vacuously
- Bijection proof
    - A is the set of subsets (S) of the Power set of Y
    - B is the set of subsets (T) of the Power set of X
    - X and {y} partitions Y
    - prove bijection Aâ†’B, Sâ†’S-{y}
    - prove injective:
        - f is injective if $f(A_1)=f(A_2), A_1,A_2\in A\implies A_1=A_2$ï»¿
        - sps. $f(A_1)=f(A_2)=A_1-\{y\}=A_2-\{y\}$ï»¿
        - then, $A_1=A_1-\{y\}\cup\{y\}$ï»¿ and $A_2=A_2-\{y\}\cup\{y\}\therefore$ï»¿ f is injective b/c A1=A2
    - prove surjective
        - if for each B in B, f(A1)=B,
        - so A1=B1 union {y}
