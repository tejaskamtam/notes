**SUMMARY  
**Companies accrue assets, liabilities, and equity in order to operate and can be tracked by accounting statements. These statements gather information from different ‚Äúaccounts‚Äù to analyze a company using a debit/credit ledger.  
Accounting information is standardized by the FSBA and is described by principles which maintain a structural system of tracking operations.  
The SEC enforces the GAAP standardization for public companies through various laws mostly created due to malpractice and economic crashes.
