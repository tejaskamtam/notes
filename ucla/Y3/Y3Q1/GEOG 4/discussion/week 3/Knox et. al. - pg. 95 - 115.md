## Problems of 1930s
- restore gold standard backed by Britain - but weak govt allowed global institutions to become weaker
- ww1 created high inflation and rising prices
- the stock market crash raised interest rates and decreased money supply in a positive feedback loop
### 2007/8 difference
- not as bad of a reactiion - government reacted quickly
- increased inflation but loosened money supply - allowed banks to recover and increased lending
- high FDI due to global corporations
### comparison to 1970s
- world conomy held togetheer ddespite global crisis (cold war, covid, etc.)
- economies are reliant on trade and dependence allows survival
- amerian power centered as currency peg, bully non-allies, made global trade more favorable for US and centered world financial economy more secured around the US


- colonialism defined Europes advantage against the Ottoman, Netherlands, and China
	- its proximity to the Americas enabled perhaps the. largest exchange of that time period of slaves, cattle, food, techniques, tech, etc.


## Eurocentric Diffusion - Blaut 1992
- suggests that the view that Britain is so much more advanced than other nations of the time is due to some ideology that Britain leads the pack while others follow and they develop technology that is far outreaching that of any competitor
- this i mostly untrue due to specific actors we have seen that make the British empire so powerful
	- colonialism, mercantilism, access to the new world, new materials, agriculture, technology, and resources
