## Background
- beginning of disorganized capitalism of post-fordism
	- breaking down govt-biz-labor collab in core econ
- declining rates of profit
- inc trade openness
- more permissive financialization of the world post-Bretton Words abrogation

## Profits Crisis: Solution
- invest in new tech and products
	- sub capital for labor
	- more niche markets for products
	- segment/separate labor and consumer markets
- go multinational to benefit from factor endowments
	- take advantage of fiscal condition, tax services, etc.
	- build foreign market shares <- saturation of domestic markets
	- Methods to go Multinational:
		- invest in foreign corps w/ M&A
		- set up alliances with foreign partners to carry out offshore production
		- set up subsidiaries and branches in multiple locations
	- incentives
		- lower prod costs
		- tax advantages of subsidiaries

- relocation of labor intensive production based on factor endowments
	- search for cheap labor and production from outsourcing

	- components from multiple sites based on factor endowments
		- ![[Pasted image 20231112231113.png]]
	- VAX - ratio of value added to gross trad -> spiked in 1970s and 80s, declining now
	- most trade is in components not final products
		- ![[Pasted image 20231112231103.png]]
	- Chinese consumption of raw materials since 1990s trended up
		- ![[Pasted image 20231112231054.png]]
