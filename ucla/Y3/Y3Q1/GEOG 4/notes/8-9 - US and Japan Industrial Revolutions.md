## Background
- expansion of global "core" to USA 1820-1920
- and Japan 1868-1945
- Porter's competitive advantage was likely the cause of the rise of very Euro-distinct countries like US and Japan
## USA
### 1820-1860 - building capacity
- government protection, stimulation
- political independence
	- used to be a resource economy for Britain pre-1787
- 1816 "Dallas" Tariff
	- encouraged **import substitution** -> protected infant industries like textiles
	- opposed by southern textile exporters
- federal government
	- common currency decreased barriers to intranational trade -> economies of scale
	- question of if slave-agrarian econ. could exist with free labor industrials simultaneously
	- subsidized agriculture
- shortage of skilled labor
	- incentivized technological development to replace
	- motivation for industrialization w/ automation
- liberal political ideology
	- individualism, enterprise-centric policy, free from religion and feudalism -> opportunity for migrants and growth
	- south was separate as econ based on plantation slavery and export of raw materials - racist, reactionary, conservative
	- gave corps tons of power to increase econ. and value of currency
### 1860-1920 - industrial power
- trusts, immigration
- Union victory in Civil War
	- southern econ. of slavery, raw goods export, and hostility to import substitution stood against north's industrialization efforts
	- Union won and allowed free wage labor for factories
- Emergence of Trusts
	- M&A of robber barons Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, Stanford - reduced competition in core markets - standard oil, steel
	- Sherman Anti-Trust 1890 - split up standard oil but remained weak in regulating monopolies
	- horizontal integration - due to economies of scale at firm level and high RnD costs -> incentivized use of capital to substitute acquiring more labor -> acquire competition
- Banks and Stock Market
	- speculative finance on futures, options, derivatives
	- risk-taking and future speculation created new industries: insurance, trading, investing, personal wealth, wealth management, consulting, etc.
- Mass Immigration 1870-1920
	- from Europe, unskilled labor, decreased factory wages and increased labor pool willing to work for as little as possible
- US manufacturing belt
	- Boston to chicago - waves of immigrants, labor organizing (unionization)
	- 1910 crisis in mass production

## Japan
### 1605-1868
- isolation, centralization
- re-established foreign restrictions after central rule from Edo (Tokyo) established <- early colonial incursions of Portuguese and Dutch during civil war period
- 1850s - isolation challenged by US and exporters
- post-1868 - systematic attempt from Japan govt to industrialize to meet foreign challenge in production (Meiji Resotration)
- limited by natural resources
### 1868-1919 and 1919-1945
- empire and militarization
#### 1868-1919
- govt pushed development of new industries
- post 1895 - industries run privately by monopolies (zaibatsu) - **Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Yasuda**
- Japanese colonialism in Korea, Wars with China, Russia and Manchuria (NE China, near Japan) and northern Korea <- for resources
- ![[Pasted image 20231031212739.png]]
#### 1919-1945
- imperial policy
	- expand in East and SE Asia to acquire resources -> fuel industries & find new markets not occupied by others like US/Europe
	- Tokyo and Osaka as two main centers on south coast of Honshu
	- ![[Pasted image 20231031212735.png]]
- post-WW2 defeat -> US occupation
	- export oriented industrialization
	- zaibatsu dismantled but large firms still dominant (Toyota, Nissan)
	- Ministry of International Trade and Industry -> increased FDI in US and Europe

## The Difference in US/Japan vs Others
- political independence
- strong central government with interaction w economy
- Mix of redistribution and market exchange -> protect infant industries, invest in infrastructure and population
- organized economic parts for competitive advantage (R&D, military spending, land grants, tax subsidies)
