## Location of Jobs
- Domestic job loci -> GDP growth
	- LA, SF, Phoenix, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, DC, Boston, NYC
	- ![[Pasted image 20231127022512.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231127022539.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231127022602.png]]
- Specialized industrial districts within the US
	- Tech - Bay, LA, DFW, Boston, NYC, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, DC

## Reasons
- Decreased transportation jobs
- Decentralization of firms -> "vertical disintegration"
	- out sourcing offshore labor/manufacturing
- agglomeration economies
### Agglomeration Economies
- local suppliers
- specialized services
- local specialized labor
- local learning effects bw firms
- trust and collaboration from interactions irl

## Regional Motors Model
- matrix of transport and communication costs vs agglomeration economies
- 6 scenarios![[Pasted image 20231127024042.png]]
	- 1 - industrial rev
	- 3 - branch-plant industrializating
		- globalization of production
		- external economies still within firms not places
	- 4 - spatial entropy (telecommunicating, remote work, zoom)
	- 6 - large metropolitan areas
		- super agglomeration economies
		- FIRE (financial, insurance, real estate)
		- NYC, London - diverse super agglomerated economies
	- 2 - industrial districts specialized in industries
		- SF/silicon valley - specialized in specific industry
- Core focuses on scenarios 6 and 2

## Summary
- redistribution of growth and jobs down to 3 points:
1. decreased transportation costs as a part of production
2. vertical disintegration of large firms from out sourcing
3. increased role of agglomeration - localization and urbanization in core

## Conclusions
- Not just changing types of jobs and locations of jobs in the core countries but also a changing economic logic to what and where they are.
- Decline in number of manufacturing jobs and as share of employment even as manufacturing production does not decline (technology)
- Rise of divided and polarized occupational distribution and income/wealth inequality
- Rising importance of agglomeration economies in new sectors
