title: 10 - Organized Capitalism in the Core

layout: note

---
## Background
- 1890-1960s
- countries in the world core -> inc focused on organization of economy within the country -> possibly argue against globalization
- bureaucratic organization of labor, companies, lobbyists, government all communicating for diplomatic resolutions to problems
## What is Organized Capitalism
- originated with monopoly capitalism and 3rd wave industrial revolution in Europe -> impacted US/Japan as well
	- vertical integration
	- firm economies of scale
	- increased government intervention
- overcoming profit squeeze (margins) by **increasing consumption** required firms to pay workers MORE to consume -> Fordism
- 1870s-1890s time of Long Depression across industrial world (esp. US) -> reversed with investments in electricity and internal combustion engine for transportation
- we can see the steep drop in consumer commodity prices 1870-1900 and recovery in 1920s in Kondratieff Wave

## How did it happen
### Govt as Mediators bw Big Firms and Labor
- increased regulation of business and finance
	- Federal Reserve - to manage currency supply
	- FDA - Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" highlighted filth and unregulated health standards in food
	- anti-monopoly legislation - Sherman Antitrust 1890
- government pension schemes
- pushed by progressive socialist politicians and workers looking for higher wages
- some biz recognized increase in wages -> increase in revenue (incl in Fordism)
### New Scientific Organization of Production
- increase worker productivity with assembly line production (Ford 1907)
- Based on **Taylorism** from Frederick Taylor
	- time and motion studies for efficient use of labor within factories
	- task specialization of interchangeable parts
	- producing Ford Model T with efficient labor productivity -> decreased to 84 distinct tasks
### Higher Wages and Higher Consumption
- increased production needed increased sales
- inc worker wage -> labor buys more -> firms sell more -> inc profit
- opposite is to pay less and produce less -> stagnation in profits and minimal revenue
- introduced cheaper products for mass consumption -> cars, advertising, consumer-credit economy (lending)
### Rise of Welfare State
- provisions of healthcare benefits by corps or govt
- state pensions, unemployment benefits
- retraining workers, mass public education
- reluctance of welfare expansion -> lobbying for welfare provides movements for powerful changes
### International Management of Trade and Currencies
- Gold standard in 1870s-1930s set Britain as the standard
- 1945-1971 Bretton Woods Agreement set US as the standard and allowed US currency to be used for international funding: IMF, World Bank, WTO, etc.
## Where did it happen
- mostly US but never fully adopted
- Federalism - states hostile to unions in the south
- liberal ideology and private vs public goods (esp. healthcare)
- less govt intervention in capital and labor relative to Europe/Japan
## Basic Business Model
- integrated firms operating nationally
	- limited outsourcing to other firms
	- limited internationalization of firms
- vertical integration
- single-site economies of scale -> everything in one building
- single-strand supply chains
	- little competition in monopolized markets
- national markets dominate capitalism
- high levels of labor unionization - national wage bargaining
- govts as brokers bw biz and labor
### Post Organized Capitalism Comparison

### Logic Behind shift to organized capitalism
- basically fordism
- to defuse hostility of social classes
	- populist and socialist movements in 1890s-1900s promoted more incentives, welfare for ppl
	- fear of overturn from capitalism to some anarchist socialist state -> organized capital to preserve liberal capitalism
- stimulate economic growth
	- recover fallen commodity prices
	- increasing consumers in population by increasing wages
- flattening business cycle
	- remove relying on seasonal availability and reliance on cyclical resources, supplies, connections, etc.
- to combine economies of scale in big corps w/ govt regulation - allow for competition
- encourage consumption as primary source of economic growth
- consumerist capitalism - econ. growth and corp dev. through consuming goods/products of companies
- prevent shift of manufacturing and labor from domestic to foreign countries
	- we see that now with the expansion to India, China, Taiwan for manufacturing
