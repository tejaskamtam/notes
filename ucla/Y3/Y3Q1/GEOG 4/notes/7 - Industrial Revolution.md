## Background
- 2nd transformative event
- lasted about 100 years in convention, long-distance trade, colonialism, worldwide investment
- geographical location continues from previous eras: shift in Europe's economic center bw 1450 - 1700
- capital accumulation funded new manufacturing and technological advancement: why NW Europe is origin of the revolution
## England as the center
- 1801 Map

- by 1900 Map
	- ![[Pasted image 20231023093730.png]]
- coal and iron mines/fields led the revolution as it was needed heavily for rail and steam engines
## Why a Revolution
- energy-intensive production w/ water and carbon: water, steam, electricity
	- for wool and textiles, assembly line, steel mill, rail, cars
	- witch from manual hand/donkey-drawn -> dams, 
- mass production - assembly line, interchangeable parts-based manufacturing, and specialized repetitive labor
	- from home-made to factory-made, continuous production (not batched per order)
	- Colt pistols, Ford cars, weaponry
- new products/innovation - steam engines, railroads, steel, chemicals, drugs
	- mostly capital goods - goods used in other goods or used to make other goods (instead of consumer goods)
- organizational changes
	- shift from merchant class importance to specialized management
	- shift from towns/villages to urban centers and industry: unskilled and immigrant labor
	- firms -> LLCs, joint-stock companies, stock market, banks, and financing manufacturing projects (Britain, France, Netherlands)
## Historical Geographical Pattern
### Cycles
- First "British" Wave, 1760-1850
	- water/canal age (cotton textiles (Liverpool), iron)
		- sold to other colonies, manufactured goods are much cheaper and skew the supply and price -> monopolization in colonies (core->periphery)
		- increases production in upland locations with water power
	- Phase I: 1760-1790: proto-industrialization
		- beginning to use water and canals for production
	- Phase II: 1790-1820: embryo industrial regions
		- scaling up production, town specialization: weaving, spinning, dyeing
		- steam engines discovery began to push industrial regions to coal/iron mines instead of around canals/waterpower
	- Phase III: 1820-1850: railway links and coalfield sites core to industrial regions
		- steam engine pushes industrial region shift around coal/iron mines
- Second Wave: 1840-1890
	- steam age (textiles, steel, chemicals, weaponry, steel ships, locomotives, rail)
	- Belgium, Northern France, Western Germany: Inner Europe
	- corporate separation from the individual for ownership of liability
	- trusts and large firms: US Steel
	- US, and Japan began to industrialize, and large firms/trusts emerge that began to monopolize: US Steel
- Third wave: 1890-1920
	- electricity, motor age (same products, capital, and consumer goods)
	- power innovations allow industrialization to move away from surrounding mines/ore fields -> urban centers
	- across Europe, Outer Europe - Sweden, Russia, Northern Italy
### Long-Wave Cycle Correlation
- Kondratieff Long-Wave cycle
	- pricing of commodities based on external worldly events
	- the three waves match with the first 3 oscillations in the graph

### Factors for New Industries
- capital from merchant capitalism, colonialism, and suppressing wages -> enabled industrialists and large-scale production and quick revolution
- application of science to production -> scale returns higher and higher
	- manufacturing science, materials science, labor distribution/factory science
- fuel sources
	- water/coal - steam
	- water, oil, coal - electricity
	- leads to the high importance of transport costs in the first 2 waves -> eased up by widespread energy production
- labor sources
	- shift in social classes away from merchant class -> class division
	- cheap labor from social class and immigrant labor
- avoiding specialized craftsman locations
	- Luddite strikes, antagonization of industrialization
- high industrial specialization per town
	- towns for spinning cotton, towns for weaving
	- gun, jewelry districts
### Principles of Industrial Location
- Britain as a source of raw materials (coal, iron fields, water canals) and a destination for investment (large banking, finance systems, LLCs, etc.)
	- captive British markets for textiles and other consumer goods
		- ![[Pasted image 20231023102709.png]]
- Transport costs and industrial location
	- Alfred Weber's "Industrial Triangle" - pulley and weights logic to determine location of production
		- S1 is "weight" of production cost 1 (iron)
		- S2 is weight of 2nd raw material 2 (coal)
		- each has a different transport ost $d(S_1),\space d(S_2)$
		- The final market for goods is M and transport cost $d(M)$
		- then pulling power will determine plant location $P$ as the most effiient location
		- ![[Pasted image 20231023103543.png]]
	- But recently , transport costs have become less central
		- manufacturing of light goods became much more popular
		- trucks and new transport tech make it much cheaper
		- shift away from burning coal constrained transport costs anyway
	- oil availability determines current transport costs
		- ![[Pasted image 20231023104042.png]]
- Economies of Scale
	- luddites lost due to this
	- major factor of winning - producing more and larger quantities (scale)
	- Long Run Average Cost Curve (LRAC) relative to cost of production
		- ![[Pasted image 20231023104204.png]]
		- I.e. until Q2, companies producing more and more at scale reduce production costs until Q2 (after which is diseconomies)
- Agglomeration economies (localization and urbanization economies)
	- agglomeration of same industry in the same areas: Pittsburgh steel, Detroit motor, Silicon Valley IT, Hollywood movies
	- localization increases returns due to agglomeration, but after that point, it becomes too costly

# Summary
- Transport costs have really diminished as a part of the locational calculus of businesses.
	- But they still matter, above all in relation to heavy industries (like steel and vehicle assembly).
	- Location close to rail lines and seaports is one of the more significant continuing impacts of transport costs given the cost of truck movement. 
	- If oil prices increase or are subjected to carbon taxes then the current reliance on long-distance ocean shipments may also diminish (independent of such factors as blocking canals!)

 - Factory or plant economies of scale are still important
	 - In fact, the concept of economies of scale extends also into considering the returns to production from serving a larger market (up to a certain point when diminishing returns set in).
	 - But as a principle of the location of production, it suggests how important having access to adequate resources and skilled labor and machines still is in driving location decisions.

- Finally, agglomeration economies have also retained their importance.
	- So far, at least before the pandemic, the idea of remote working substituting for face-to-face engagement had not led anywhere much. Time will tell.
	- But this principle seems very well justified if the past two hundred years is any guide!!
