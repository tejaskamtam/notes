# Summary
1. The modern world economy has had a number of common persistent features
	1. increasingly a single worldwide market
	2. politically fragmented
	3. threefold geographical tiers
	4. cyclical trend in prices driven by technological innovation
2. But also some important trends that have not been persistent
	1. from competitive to organized to disorganized capitalism
	2. ‚Äúnational capitalisms‚Äù adapting differently to global trends
	3. shortening business cycle
	4. technology impacts lessening leading to weakening of long-wave cycle
3. The rest of the course will examine how these varied features have played out across the world with some attention to late 1700s-1970 but mainly with a focus on the period since 1970.
	1. Examining the importance of the Industrial Revolution in Europe and then in the United States and Japan to the expansion of the modern world economy lays the foundation for the rest of the course.
