- many services however are not mobile e.g. personal services
- some producer services are, esp those through telecomms: call centers, physician radiology, lawyers, etc. -> so some producer services will follow manufacturing out-sourcing
## Off-Shoring White Collar Jobs

	- labor-intensive producer services (call centers, back office, health services) done at a cheaper price
