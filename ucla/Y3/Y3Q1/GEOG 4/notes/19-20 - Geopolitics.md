## US and China in context
- 4 major geopolitical eras:
	- European Colonialism: 1815-1875
	- Inter-Imperial Rivalry: 1875-1945
	- Cold War: 1945-1990
	- Post-1990: Market access and networked power
		- global supply chains etc, very diff to previous eras
- Focus points
	- US decline?
	- Rise of china?
	- states and city-networks
- GDP vs GDP per capita

#### Cons to "Rising China" -> Pros to "Slipping US"
- biggest companies still in US-based (may have large foreign asseets) and GDP and role of US$ as corporate trade

### Critique of Comparison
- Might not be as useful as a comparison as we think:
- decoupling and protectionism
	- ![[Pasted image 20231206021301.png]]
- world's outlook and reliance on US
	- ![[Pasted image 20231206021308.png]]

	- ![[Pasted image 20231206021350.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231206021355.png]]
### Conclusions
- China-US compeition is anxious: each is inderdependent to each other and to the world economy
- US as the center of globalization may mistake China as one of the largest investors that allowed for its rise
- nation representation may be an issue: perhaps world-city system is a larger part of glboal economics, not just states


## World-City System
- model for world economy supported by urban trade centers as megacities throughout the world instead of state-based trade; reasons:
- transport cost vs agglomeration econ
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207011835.png]]
- cities as growth nodes
	- east asia and southern hemisphere mostly sent forward by major cities
		- ![[Pasted image 20231207011928.png]]
	- world is less Euro-central and less focus on NA as large cities throughout the world create connectioncs and are organized around intercity networks
		- ![[Pasted image 20231207011922.png]]
- privatization of political authority
	- credit rating
		- ![[Pasted image 20231207011935.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20231207011942.png]]
	- low tax jurisdictions
		- ![[Pasted image 20231207011949.png]]
- megacities and evolving city-systems
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207011957.png]]
- large cities without agglomeration economies
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207012010.png]]
- technological limits to economic growth
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207012019.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207012036.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207012041.png]]
- transport costs increasing
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207012048.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231207012054.png]]
### Conclusions
- Cities rule in the world economy with agglomeration economies
- cities are the dominant nodes of growth today more so than the past
- not all urbanization is productive in therms of growth and increasing incomes (most wages are down and standard of living falls)
- we may be coming to the limits to growth from technology and sustainability standpoints
	- the biggest challenge to globalization
