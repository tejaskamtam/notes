## Introduction
- Diminishing world empires and feudalism gave way to colonialism and mercantilism
- this developed across the new world and western Europe and secluded in China
- Why Europe? China's limit to expansion was their falling compared to expansive greedy european new empires
- Cast system developed based on labor as a method of socio-economic las differentiation
## Types of Economies
### Karl Polanyi
- Reciprocity
	- based on Trust
	- usually expanded locally as political or familial expansion
- Redistribution - Polanyi argues the world has been like this for a MAJORITY of the time
	- relies on coercion and colonies/territories
	- based heavily on militaristic power and bound locally (continental)
- Market Exchange
	- The rise of the new world economy across expansive trade hubs and markets
	- fueled by anonymity and portability across the globe - no need for direct coercion, proxies
### Immanuel Wallerstein
- mini-systems
	- localized towns and intra-territorial trade
- empires
	- redistribution-eque based on trade bw superpowers and colonies/territories
- world economy
	- what wee know today as large-scale trade between world cities, beyond empires and land ownership

## Modern World Economy
### Market Exchange Driven
- the anonymity of parties and long-distance trade
- prices decided in the market for goods/services
- loans and interest to fuel financing to procure goods/services
- insurance markets for security and risk/trust issues
- reliable currencies backed by gold/silver
	- now, mostly govt backed by central bank - fiat currency
	- real gold and silver coins for the longest time
- market places, locations, infrastructure, easy travel
	- needs roads, water, food, and towns nearby
	- internet and easy global access is very new
	- physical banks, merchants, fairs
### Other Principles
- reciprocity survives in kinship/familial exchange, monarchies, etc.
	- self-perpetuating political class through nepotism
- redistribution as core principle of empire development
	- production favors home country
	- autarky in Soviet states and welfare states
- some countries and monopolies still use tactics to transform into "empires"

## History of Early European World Economy
### 15th to 16th cent.
- western Europe: modern Italy to Flanders (northern Belgium, Netherlands)
- fall of feudalism and shift to market exchange
- city-states as centers of exchange - Florence
- merchant class - developed as a new and large socio-economic class
- banking and insurance - regulation of usury by govts and religion
- limited liability company
- increased agriculture and manufacturing
- new world
- concurrent empire building (Spain, Portugal) - more gold/silver in market
### 16th cent. to Present
- blend of market exchange and redistribution (through colonialism)
	- drawing in resources from colonies and then investing in inside-out infrastructure and selling manufactured goods to captive markets
- Market exchange thrived
	- Western Europe in 16th Century, early 18th Century Europe, late 19th Century Europe, and North America
- Since the mid-20th Century, market exchange has risen to greatest worldwide prominence
	- end of empires, end of colonialism (mostly), fall of state-based economies like Soviet Union
## Western Europe vs China - 1500s
- China had a single centralized government - Western Europe was divided politically
- China had meritocratic civil service - European nepotism
- China is largely autarkic (economic self-sufficiency), with not much external trade
- China had a labor-intensive rice economy - Europeâ€™s land-based cereal and cattle economy
- Europe had private banking
- Europe had some advantages in navigation and weapons but not in other technologies
