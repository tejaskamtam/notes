## Feudalism to Mercantilism
- the modern economy developed from feudalism as it emerged in post-roman Mediterranean loci
- the main differences in merchant economy is:
	- politics - the expectation of those at the bottom on the top's obligation to increase the quality of life for all
	- trade networks - long-distance large-scale connections between regions enable a widespread market of goods -> financial services, and commodities

	- status competition - caste systems, social hierarchy, competition
- By the 1400s, pandemics of the 1300s and trade hubs across Eurasia and innovations in technology/agriculture-> people moved to trade hubs -> urbanization and trade powers emerged
## Geography of Europe's transition (Feudalism to Capitalism)
- city-state Europe (1400s-1530)
	- rise of merchant class, banking systems
	- This happened in a belt running from central and northern Italy northwards to Flanders - the center of European merchant capitalism
	- credit-exchange -> market exchange enabled by merchants -> spread of wealth and ideas
	- pressure under Spanish and Portuguese conquest -> increased learning and spread of ancient Greek and arab philosophers and texts
	- creation of new arts, architecture, paintings, etc. paid by merchants and church
- discoveries, early colonialism, the spread of Spanish/Portuguese wealth through the military (1500-1600)
	-   spanish/Portuguese leaders turn their wealth through gold and precious metals from Mexico, Peru, etc. 
	- an overspending and thin spread of rule across the Iberian peninsula and central Europe ( Habsburg, now Italy, Venice, Genoa, Rome) -> threatened by emerging English, french, and Dutch republics
	- biggest failures: The Spanish Armada of 1588 - mostly due to invasion of England in bad weather, dutch revolt, and rebellion - led to sovereignty of Dutch Republic
- mercantilism in NW Europe (England, France, Netherlands) (1550-1700)
	- balance of payments - accumulate capital with low imports, high exports -> currency control (storing gold and silver), encouraging risky foreign ventures by underwriting them publically and sanctioning by govt
	- privateering/bullion - government-sanctioned pirating to steal gold/silver bullion of Spanish, Arab, and Mughal ships in the high sea
	- state-licensed companies - East India, Dutch East India, Hudson's bay companies -> monopolies over regions of Eurasia
	- much more government-organized mercantilism as compared to 1530 mercantilism of Italy

## Summary
- Market Exchange in Medieval Europe
- rise of trade overtaking feudalism
- fragmentation of political power
- fragmented powers challenged by redistributive impulses from colonization (Spanish, Portuguese)
- mercantilism in NW Europe based on trading but operating alongside colonial empires
- merchant capitalism led to increasing power in the hands of wealth and commerce over the control of land (feudalism)
- a world economy: a world that should know no boundaries in the search for profit
