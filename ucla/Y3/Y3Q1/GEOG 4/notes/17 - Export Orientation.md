title: 17 - Export Orientation

layout: note

---
## Why?
- import substitution vs export oreinted manufacturing
	- historically import sub allowed for econ. domestic growth
	- but only sustainable by export oriented production
	- size of countries -> economies of scale
	- 1920s start imitation of US and Japan during industrial rev
	- after 1970s export oriented made more sense for small countries, epzs for strategic partynerships with multinational biz and FDI
### Practical Logic of Export Orientation for Econ. Growth
1. manufacture strage of econ growth

2. phases of production and factors of production (product life cycle metaphor)

	2. ![[Pasted image 20231203230105.png]]
	3. ![[Pasted image 20231203230134.png]]
3. decline in transport costs and rise of global supply chain

4. From EPZs to industrial districts

### Vulnerabilities
- fuel costs and sustainability of long dist supply chains
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203230312.png]]
- JIT manufacture and flexibility of components -> adjacency advantage e.g. mexico and US

	- ![[Pasted image 20231203230429.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203230443.png]]
- factor endowments not forever, e.g. low labor costs hindered by aging labor forces
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203230532.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203230537.png]]
- geopolitics of glob econ comp and rise of protectionism in historic core

## Where?
- growth of globval manufacturing output in 1995-2005
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203230733.png]]
- three tests of industrialization
	- (1) >= 25% of GDP in industry
	- (2) >= 60% of industrial output in manufacturing
	- (3) >= 10% of total pop. in industry
	- Pathways of success:
		- E->C->A: mining -> resources -> manufacture
			- rare, possibly african resource heavy countries
			- Saudi arabia w oil
		- D->B->A: manufacture -> expansion -> employment
			- common in SE/East Asia and Mexico, Brazil

- Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs)
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231035.png]]
- NOT happening in Middle East and Africa except South Africa
	- conflict, split up states, lack of solidarity, etc.
- BRICs - full on export-orientation
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231136.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231147.png]]
### China
- China as most imp NIC in BRICs
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231222.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231229.png]]
	- period of growth passed
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231251.png]]
- Sino-dependency of neighbors and world economy since 2005 - major creditor to US, known as global growth engine
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231331.png]]
### Other Places/More In-depth Intra-country
- Cities as major centers of new industrial growth w pop growth wo econ. growth (e.g. Asia, Africa) -> incomes stagnate
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231457.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231501.png]]
- Cities beyond core rising in global importance
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231525.png]]
- Semi-periphery increasingly responsible for worldwide econ growth
	- manufacturing etc
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203231607.png]]

## Conclusion
- countries match their factor endowments and multinationals global supply chains
- opening up of the world economy since 1970s w tariff reductions, end of bretton woods, etc.
- competitive advantage built by some countries on the base of import substitution and capital investment in infrastructure and human capital
- emerging frim-off-shoring economies of scale and agglomeration in some major cities outside of core: beijing, madras epz, etc
