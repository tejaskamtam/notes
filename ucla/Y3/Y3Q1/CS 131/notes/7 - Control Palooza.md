## Expressions, Associativity, and Order of Eval
- C++ is not deterministic in the evaluation of the terms of an expression, e.g. evaluating a function in an arithmetic expression or evaluating a function passed as a parameter
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129151149.png]]
	- Instead, it leaves it to the compiler to optimize
	- so, we should write pure code that does not introduce possible side effects
- most mathematical expressions are left-associative and are returned in normal mathematical order, but there are some exceptions
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129151801.png]]
## Short-Circuiting
- The program will optimize boolean expressions so that it will "short circuit" and only evaluate as few expressions as possible, left-to-right
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129152123.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129152151.png]]
- short-circuiting is expected but not guaranteed, depends on the lang
## Control Statements
### Unconditional Branching
- ![[Pasted image 20231129153643.png]]
#### GOTO
- assign labels to lines of code
- jump to the label/line
- can introduce undefined behavior if not careful
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129154304.png]]

#### BREAK and CONTINUE
- ![[Pasted image 20231129154350.png]]
- new features allow you to break from labeled loops and continue to labeled loops
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129154541.png]]

### Conditionals
- `IF` was first used in Fortran to jump to line numbers based on flags for whether the number is negative, zero, or positive
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129155020.png]]
- Ternary operator is if else in 1 line w 3 operands
	- ![[Pasted image 20231204141108.png]]
- null coalescing operator: if true then pas s the var else pass alt
	- ![[Pasted image 20231204141119.png]]
- safe navigation operator, checks if the navigation is valid else entire statement is false/null
	- ![[Pasted image 20231204141130.png]]
### Switch statements
- started in fortran with a goto and line numbers
- ![[Pasted image 20231204142748.png]]
## Loops
- ![[Pasted image 20231204142816.png]]
### Counter-controlled iteration
- iterates over a range of values (foreach)
- ![[Pasted image 20231204143228.png]]
### Collection-controlled iteration
- iterates over the elements in an iterable objects
- ![[Pasted image 20231204143531.png]]
### Conditional Looping
- while and do while
- do always runs the 1st iteration


## Iteration
- Looping/iteration through an iterable object
- these are the types of loops: ![[Pasted image 20231204144613.png]]
### Iterable objects
- an **iterable object** is an object that can be iterated over using an **iterator**: a collection, list, sequence, range, etc.
- we can iterate using iterators or first class functions
- ![[Pasted image 20231204144824.png]]
### Iterators
- an object that allows the enumeration of an iterable object's values without exposing the underlying representation
- ![[Pasted image 20231204144935.png]]
- iterators are typically distinct from the value they enumerate, but to the programmer, it is an abstraction so we can not know if it actually caches or just points
- iterators are distinct from the iterable object so we can have multiple iterators for the same iterable
- iterators are generated by the iterable object and may become invalid over execution (e.g., if you delete an object in a vector in C++, the iterator becomes invalid )
- ![[Pasted image 20231204150528.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20231204150542.png]]
- Iterators are implemented via: ![[Pasted image 20231204151247.png]]
#### With Traditional Classes:
- Implementing a container: ![[Pasted image 20231204151338.png]]
- Implementing a range: ![[Pasted image 20231204153203.png]]
#### With Generators (True Iterators)
- A generator in python:
	- ![[Pasted image 20231204154315.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231204154659.png]]
- Iterating through a generator:
	- ![[Pasted image 20231204154748.png]]

### First Class Functions for Iteration
- we can create a simple mapping member function that does a for each loop and calls the passed function
