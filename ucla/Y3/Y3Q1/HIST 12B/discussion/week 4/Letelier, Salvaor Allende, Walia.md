## Salvadore Allende
### Background
"Salvador Allende: Coup D'Etat in Santiago" is a documentary film that examines the events leading up to the coup d'Ã©tat that took place in Santiago, Chile, in 1973, resulting in the overthrow of President Salvador Allende. The film presents various arguments and perspectives, including:
### Topics
1. Political Conflict: The documentary highlights the intense political conflict in Chile during the early 1970s. Salvador Allende, a democratically elected socialist president, implemented a series of radical reforms, including nationalizing industries and land redistribution, which caused tension with the United States and powerful domestic interests.
2. U.S. Involvement: The film suggests that the United States, through agencies like the CIA, played a role in destabilizing Allende's government due to concerns about the spread of communism in the region. The U.S. government is accused of supporting and funding opposition groups and fostering economic instability in Chile.
3. Economic Crisis: The documentary discusses how Chile's economy faced severe challenges during Allende's presidency, including hyperinflation, food shortages, and labor strikes. Critics argue that these issues were a result of Allende's policies, while his supporters argue they were partly caused by external pressures.
4. Role of the Military: The film explores the role of the Chilean military, led by General Augusto Pinochet, in the coup. It presents the argument that the military, with the support of various political and economic elites, played a key role in overthrowing Allende's government.
5. Human Rights Abuses: "Salvador Allende" also addresses the human rights abuses and repression that followed the coup, including the establishment of a military dictatorship under Pinochet, which resulted in the torture, disappearance, and killing of many Chileans.
### Summary
Overall, the documentary "Salvador Allende: Coup D'Etat in Santiago" presents a complex web of political, economic, and international factors that contributed to the coup and the subsequent authoritarian regime in Chile. It offers a range of perspectives on these events, reflecting the contentious nature of this historical period.


## Orlando Letelier
### Background
Orlando Letelier's article, "Economic 'Freedom's' Awful Toll," published in The Nation on August 28, 1976, presents a critical perspective on the concept of economic freedom and its consequences. The article's arguments can be summarized as follows:
### Topics
1. Economic Freedom as a Myth: Letelier argues that the notion of economic freedom, often championed by proponents of free-market capitalism, is a myth. He suggests that true economic freedom is rarely achieved in practice, as economic power tends to concentrate in the hands of a few individuals or corporations, leading to exploitation and inequality.
2. Social Injustice: Letelier contends that the pursuit of economic freedom, as defined by laissez-faire capitalism, often leads to social injustice and the marginalization of vulnerable populations. He points to the unequal distribution of wealth and resources as evidence of this.
3. Exploitation of Workers: The article highlights the negative impact of unregulated capitalism on workers, arguing that the pursuit of profits often comes at the expense of labor rights, fair wages, and safe working conditions. Letelier emphasizes the suffering of the working class under the banner of economic freedom.
4. Influence of Multinational Corporations: Letelier criticizes the role of multinational corporations, asserting that their pursuit of profit can lead to human rights abuses and environmental degradation, particularly in developing countries where regulations may be weaker.
5. Call for Reform: In his article, Letelier calls for a reevaluation of the principles of economic freedom. He advocates for a more just and equitable economic system that considers the welfare of all citizens and addresses the negative externalities associated with unbridled capitalism.
### Summary
In summary, Orlando Letelier's article challenges the conventional notion of economic freedom, highlighting its detrimental effects on society, particularly in terms of income inequality, worker exploitation, and the influence of multinational corporations. He calls for a more balanced and socially responsible approach to economic policy.
## Harsha Walia: Border and Rule, ch. 2,5-6
### Chapter 2 - Border Imperialism
- Border as a war on terrorism -> expands the capability of determining criminality
- War on drugs - new policing justified by law emphasizes neoliberal culture and distinction of poor as a cultural issue

-  
### Chapter 3 - Dispossession in Developing Countries
- Export processing zones - an area of lawlessness in exports
- e.g. garment industry has absolute control over workers -> accumulates debt, and pushes the poverty line further and further up

- Systemic immobility around the border
### Chapter 5 - Australian Migration Policy

- things like this arose from colonialism to use the country as a dumping site -> indigenous deaths

- Now, anyone wo a valid visa could be detained perpetually -> disproportionately impacted ppl with instability -> detainment centers -> sexual harassment, self-harm/mutilation

- E - Greece balkans - treacherous routes, EU use Greece as a death stop
- S - Mediterranean deadliest route - EU criminalizing border passing and frames it as a war on human trafficking
