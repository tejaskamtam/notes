## Wendy Brown - “American Nightmare: Neoliberalism, Neo-conservatism, and De-Democratization,”
- Neoliberalism juxtaposes neoconservatism - but when they intersect, it can be bad for govt
- the continued privatization of economic markets + the support of conservative govt -> de-democratization -> no individualism (elitism, oligarchy) -> the privatization of commons
- policy like this draws distinctions between migrant and domestic workers
- detaching health from something available to all to a small subset of people constrained to citizenship
	- ties health to nationality and citizenship
