## Harsha Walia, *Border and Rule* Ch. 11 - Refusing Reactionary Neoliberalism, pg. 196-204
- this chapter focuses on the characteristics of Nationalism through the lens of their perspectives on race and immigration
- Walia introduces the topic by quoting a Trump tweet which targeted 4 congresswomen with a tweet that basically wrote "go back to your country"
- Walia suggests this expands beyond simple insults and paints a picture of what America sees racialized people as: the scapegoat
	- treating them as perpetual outsiders, normalizing European colonialism
	- supporting white supremacy presenting racialized people as terrorists
- Walia expands this argument to immigrants as well by considering various threats and insults common to American "culture", specifically identifying the hate as calling them freeloaders but contradictorily stealing jobs
- Walia makes a lot of claims about how this xenophobia is the center of ableism, imperialism, racism, border control, etc.
- Walia also notes the difference in classical liberalism, neoliberalism, and this emerging over-encompassing nature emerging from the far right: nationalism
- Walia explains the historical reaction towards racism as viewed in classical liberalism as existing separate from the economy and politics but now changed to liberal multiculturalism which tries to incorporate diversity into liberalism but ultimately furthers the emergence of nationalism by drawing clear distinctions in culture, ethnicity, and race
- increasing the depth of consideration of liberal multiculturasim, Walia picks the conept apart with other individuals' takes on the subject ultimately supporting the point that the philosophy makes many false assumptions on solidarity of race and deemphasizes the wealth and wellbeing hierarchy present in the west
	- e.g., affirmative action, quotas, segregation, 
### "Class through the Prism of Race"
- Trump's support in the 2016 election came from middle-class and rich white voters who aimed to maintain racial capitalism, but Overt white supremacy is rising across all classes in the US and the Western world e.g., Freedom Party in Austria, Lega Nord in Italy, Danish People's party in Denmark.
	- although not white supremacy, nationalism is spreading further - large populations of Japan's elderly protesting against immigration into Japan, BJP becoming anti-secular in India, China's Communist Party influencing many developing countries (semi-periphery) to take a political direction that might have a chance at increasing growth
- Far-right forces weaponize the crisis of neoliberalism for working people but propose a messianic rescue rather than actual redistribution.
- The far-right constructs threats to the working class across ethnic or racial lines, leading to ethnonationalism and maintaining an elitist status quo.
- Walia claims the formation of the "white working class" is a feature of "race making" at the expense of the overall working-class -> highlighting a nationalist push for division in pay/labor opportunities
- Whiteness is a possessive force affording white people the full status and protection of citizenship, as well as economic advantages.
- The idea that race, gender, and sexuality are particular while class is universal is challenged, emphasizing the interconnectedness of struggles for liberation.
### "Making of ‚ÄúForeigner‚Äù through Nationalist Identities"
- Labor Zionism in Israel established a workers' utopia to prioritize Jewish workers, reinforcing ethnic separatism in the labor force.
- The construction of a national working class is used to pit citizens against noncitizens, as seen in Greece during protests against migrants.
- Calls to "protect our jobs" based on citizenship condition class through citizenship, imbuing economic value as a form of property.
- Welfare nationalism controls public services as a form of bordered exclusion to allegedly defend the nation's workers.
- Racialized xenophobia blunts class consciousness and allows elites to impose austerity measures and expand capital accumulation.
- Far-right movements frame opposition to the EU as a challenge to foreign imposition, aligning with anti-immigration sentiments.
- Nationalist protectionism historically targets Asian migrants and contributes to the racialization of the white working class.
- Labor movements demanding job protection from "foreign" workers align with far-right racism and reproduce the logic of scarcity.
- Identifying global capitalist institutions as "foreign" bolsters the nation-state, supporting far-right and left-wing critiques.
- The belief that the state can protect against capitalism misrecognizes the state's role in racial capitalism and colonial empires.
- Trump's protectionist trade wars and opposition to trade agreements do not oppose neoliberalism but aim to advance US capital interests.
- Nationalisms bound to the state cannot be a real opposition to neoliberalism, and an internationalist struggle is needed to dismantle capitalism, the state, racism, and hierarchized relations.
  
## Writing Exercise
I had long considered neoliberalism to be a net positive for our socio-economy, supporting market exchange and facilitating the growth of nations through the push for corporate backing, funding, and the push for emerging small businesses. However, having taken this class, I am now perched on the completely other ledge across this canyon of neoliberalism that extends much further than the "shallow depth" the eye can see. Neoliberalism, at its core, upholds the concept of the market and pushes every form of competition in the market to compete at a level unseen by any period of time before. The competition introduces the creation of monopolies in markets, fluctuating market prices, impacting political and national policy worldwide, favoring the elite running the large corporations that own the world. They even impact the microcosmic facets of our society through their support and resistance to ideologies emerging from the working class and poor, setting them aside for a more powerful, corpo-controlled, corrupt society.
