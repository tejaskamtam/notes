# Hayek
- criticism of central planning
- suggested Nazis (National Socialist) emerged from a socialist movement that allowed fascism to grow as a controlling power antithetical to socialism -> capitalism prospered under Nazi rule
- comparing Stalin soviet to Nazi fascism suggesting they were similar in totalitarian control
- overlaps with Ropke's discussion that religion as a method of spreading economic activity
- Fascism is due to too much central planning - even though Nazis were hardly socialist
- Notes
	- Individual Liberty: Hayek asserts that individual liberty and economic freedom are inseparable. He argues that when governments exert control over economic planning and decision-making, it often leads to a loss of personal freedoms.
	- Central Planning: Hayek is critical of central planning and believes that it can lead to unintended consequences and inefficiencies. He argues that the complexity of the modern economy makes it impossible for a central authority to successfully manage all aspects of production and distribution.
	- The Road to Totalitarianism: Hayek warns that the path to central planning and socialism, while often well-intentioned, can ultimately lead to totalitarianism. He contends that giving a government too much power over the economy can result in authoritarian rule.
	- Spontaneous Order: Hayek emphasizes the importance of spontaneous order in a free market system. He argues that market forces, competition, and the price system allow for the coordination of individual actions and information, leading to efficient outcomes.
	- The Rule of Law: Hayek advocates for the rule of law as a safeguard against arbitrary government actions. He believes that a predictable legal framework is essential for protecting individual rights and ensuring a functioning society.
	- Social Justice and Equality: Hayek challenges the concept of social justice and economic equality as outcomes that can be effectively imposed by government. He argues that such attempts often undermine individual freedom and lead to unintended consequences.
# Slobodian
- wants colonial world order to exist as it was under imperialist rule
- racist viewpoints
- Ropke suggests federalism for countries like South Africa but with economic freedom for privatization and competition
	- taking away economic freedom will help social welfare in large economies
	- this means countries in the third world are influenced by large capitalism -> insidiously believing economic freedom is better for them (cheap labor, resource control, etc.)
- Neoliberalists did not consider the consequences of economic competition 
- incentivized outsourcing and the destruction of third-world economies and labor markets in economic powerhouses
- Global north sets up international institutions that work in the favor of neoliberalism (IMF, WTO) that bail out countries on economic conditionality
# Prashad
- talking about the history leading into the 20th cent.
- G7 summit and top economies of the world
- Atlantic project - transatlantic imperialism
- Third World project - wealth concentration and economic powerhouses
- suggests large economies dominate other non-competitive or smaller growing countries - inhibiting growth due to devastating governmental implications due to the pressure of large capitalism
- neoliberalisms impact on international relation
- the emphasis of neo-colonialism -> in favor of global north
# Friedman
- suggesting individualization to collectivism enables a social welfare state that is antithetical to capitalism -> but limits to a social welfare state requires capitalism to solve and privatize social welfare
- collectivism also parallels in the economy from individual led markets to corporate collections of monopoly
- expressly suggesting the return of liberallism not what was suggested by neoliberalism of current day

1. Defense of Classical Liberalism: Friedman defends the principles of classical liberalism, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom, limited government intervention, and the free market as the foundation for economic and political systems.
    
2. Role of the State: He argues that the state should have a limited role in the economy, primarily focused on enforcing property rights, maintaining the rule of law, and ensuring a stable monetary framework.
    
3. Opposition to Government Planning: Friedman criticizes government planning and central economic control, contending that these can lead to inefficiency, waste, and a lack of individual incentives.
    
4. Competitive Capitalism: Friedman advocates for competitive capitalism as a means of promoting innovation and economic growth. He believes that free markets encourage competition, which, in turn, leads to better outcomes for consumers and society.
    
5. Monetary Policy: Friedman suggests that central banks should follow a stable and predictable monetary policy, avoiding excessive money supply growth to prevent inflation and economic instability.
    
6. Critique of Welfare State: He raises concerns about the welfare state, arguing that excessive government intervention in providing social services can lead to inefficiency, dependency, and reduced individual responsibility.
    - but supported social welfare more than some current republican thought - but nowhere near scandinavian social welfare

8. International Trade: He supports free trade and criticizes protectionist policies, emphasizing the benefits of international exchange for economic growth and prosperity.
