## NYC Fiscal Crisis
- deindustrialization & suburbization dec NYC econ
- loss of pop, tax, jobs, good homes, underfunded schools -> social unrest
- used municipal bonds and expanded public employment, provisions, and federal funding
- Nixon determined crisis over in early 1970s and cut back federal funding
- introduced opportunity for fin institutions
- Citibank refused to rollover debt -> instead agreed to buyout after city bankruptcy on the condition of restructuring city budget (austerity)
- introduced fees for public services to pay off bond holders first (like tuition at CUNY, fees at MTA)
- required municipal unions to invest pensions in city managed bonds
- NYC appeals to fed -> fed sec says NO to bail out suggesting it is a punishment for free public services and high wages?!?
- -> infra deteriorated, unemployment rose, wages declined, schools closed
- finance capital makes NYC business friendly
	- public funds for tele infra
	- biz subsidies and tax incentives
	- econ redirected to finance
- NYC did not bankrupt but crisis was from years of crisis and suburbanization not overpaid unions or welfare
## Neolib Dem: Carter 1976-80
- Carter and Ford supported reduced taxes, cut spending, backed strict measures to pull out of recession
- cut welfare funding like aid to families and dependent children, food stamps under guise of cutting fraud/abuse
- reduced taxes on wealthy, launched first efforts of deregulation of airline, transport, and financial
- appointed Paul Volcker as Fed Chair 1979
### Paul Volcker Shock Therapy
- attacked inflation by contracting money supply and raising interest rates by 2x in 1981
- tighter credit -> reduced consumer spending -> fewer loans -> corps cut back on investment -> firms go under -> mass unemployment -> manufacturing throughput falls -> unemployment > 11%
## Tax Revolt (California)
- home prices in 1973 are below average then 1979 are 42k higher, then 1988 143k higher
- property taxes are rising during stagflation
- Jarvis-Gann initiative/Proposition 13 1978 - reduced state's property tax rev from 12 bil to 5 bil
- set max real estate tax, reduced property tax rate by 80%
### Impact of Prop 13
- loss of revenue -> cuts in basic services (police, fire, hospital, water, maintenance, sewer)
- anti-immigrant sentiment, Californians down voting bonds to support public schools (xenophobia)
### Regulatory Capture
- suggests state can help maintain free markets and promote business
- Stigler's thesis is that the regulators should be the regulated: finance firms should regulate finance industry, etc.
- state should be used to provide public subsidy for industries, bailouts, manage entry of new competitors, adjust prices (against von Mises args), and laws to regulate labor
### Lobbyists
- chamber of commerce, NAM, etc. and think tanks like American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation pushed for neolib policy
- 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act - authorized PACs (init for labor to have a greater say) but created many many more corp PACs
- e.g. deregulation of banks -> no credit limits, relocation to slip past usary rights, invest in risky instruments -> many bank mergers
## Reaganomics
- break air traffic controllers strike 1981 -> threat to unionization
- "supply side econ." - tax cuts, deregulation would stimulate biz and reduce govt power/size -> suggests govt is the problem
- tax cuts subsidized corp mvmt to sunbelt non unionized states
- corp taxes reduced from 70% to 28%
- drastically cut welfare spending
- raised military spending from 4.9% GDP to 5.8% (military inc by 46% -> housing and education slashed by 70-77%)
