## Social Wage
- the govt expenditure on welfare
- includes unemployment income, stipends, stimulus, children/elderly support, subsidies for low income, subsidized healthcare, govt investment in making life better
### War on Poverty
- poor ppls movements for radically diff economic systems were defeated by big corp
- war on poverty - from cold-war from idea of aid
- US push for free-market as the sol - solves poverty, but bc US still has poverty, foreign aid became domestic aid -> poor are foreign and ppl need to assimilate to "culture" to treat poverty as a problem of culture
- "capitalism is not the reason for poverty, its culture" (work ethic, etc.)
### Failed "War" (onpoverty)
- pre to post war caused 25% less poverty in Blacks and 43% less for Whites
- corps focused on job training instead of making more jobs
- high cost of vietnam war -> less resources for increasing poverty line (not solving income inequality, suitable income, safe working places, etc. ONLY poverty)
### King family on Poverty
- took a stand against free-market as the solution to poverty
- against vietnam war - lost them a ton of funding and support when most ppl supported war (later changed)
- Corretta King: "peace and justice are not indivisible"
- supported "Freedom budget" radical views on govt sanctioned socialist welfare
### NWRO, Feminist, Anti-capital vision
- NWRO (National Workers Rights Org) a feminist movment led mostly by black women suggesting work rights are civil rights
- suggested childcare and housework is unpaid labor and should be treated as paid (data to suggest industry is 10.9 trillion globally and 1.5 trillion US)
- women and poor should deserve to be treated w dignity -> increased welfare and removed stigma of welfare 
## Guaranteed Annual Income
- anyone below the poverty line receives GAI
- to decouple marriage, employment ,and personal behavior from criteria for aid
	- ppl would check for the presence of men, jobs, etc. to make sure there is no income source
- would've significantly decreased costs of govt welfare efforts previously (due to logistical issues of all the bs laws)
- would've replaced the stigma based system of food stamps, free lunch, embarrassment, etc
### Nixon's Poverty Plan
- one of the only prez that considered GAI
- realized it would decrease welfare bureaucracy
- but did not consider cost of living which led to inequitable social wage

## Monetarism & Crisis
- econ theory that focuses on macroeconomic effects of money supply (introduced with Keynes)
- Friedman argued against suggesting money supply regulation is inflationary and should only be used for price stability
- Friedman opposed Bretton Woods (idea of US international dollar pegged to gold) and promoted tight monetary policy to handle inflation -> argued for floating forex to allow market to determine value
### Vietnam & Econ Crisis 1965-1971-1974
- war drained 9.5% of GDP -> increased debt -> run on gold
- by 1971, 300 billion overseas due to exports, war, tourism, forex
- Nixon tried to curb inflation w wage freezes and monetary policy to raise interest rates -> Stagflation
- Stagflation - low economy, inflation, low employment
- 1971 - US abandons gold for fiat
- recession forced biz to lay off workers -> reduced tax revenue
- volatile exchange rates -> forex & futures trading
- fiat money allowed US to increase supply by 40% by 1973 (British by 70%) -> inflation
- 1973 - Arab OPEC launches Oil embargo for anti-support of Israel war -> high gas prices, limited oil -> increased crisis
### Impact of Crisis on Working Class
- relative wages decline to price of goods
- unemployment doubled bw 73-75 -> 9.5% in 82
- -> strikes -> neoliberal conception of strikes as a problem -> weaken unions
- 1970s deindustrialization/capital-flight
	- 4 million jobs lost to firms relocating outside of US
	- 32 million lost as shutdown, relocation, scale-back
- Coretta King's push for full employment - led NCFE/FEAC
	- President Ford's policies did tax cuts, credits for biz -> didn't create jobs or dec unemployment
	- NCFE/FEAC rejected Ford's policies -> pushed for inc public sector jobs, extending unemployment benefits, lower interest rates, invest in alternative energy to combat oil monopoly
	- Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act 1978 - goal of 3% unemployment -> less abt employment, more abt economic growth, price stability, more balanced budget -> all goals driven by corp
