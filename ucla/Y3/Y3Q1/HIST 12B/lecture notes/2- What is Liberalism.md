## Liberalism

- concept of ‚Äúliberty of the individual‚Äù

### 7 Principles

- freedom of thought and speech
- consent from the people for the legitimacy of political power
- limited government
- application of the rule of law - law enforcement
- market economy
- transparent and democratic system of government

### Classical liberalism

- real freedom - freedom from coercion
- state intervention is considered coercive power
- laissez-faire econ. policy
- 19th cent. - emphasized free trade (contradicted need for tariffs to maintain security)

### Modern Liberalism

- unacknowledged foundations
- based on idea that liberty places property before human freedom and needs
- a definition that PERMITS unfree labor, dispossession, subordination based on race, gender, etc.]
- thus, slavery, dispossession, colonialism, genocide were not AGAINST liberalism (many latin and european philosophers allowed this as liberalism)

### Liberal exclusions

- who is human?
    - savages/barbarians not self-governed were seen as justification for enslavement/colonialism and clarified/supported it
    - move from state of nature to political society was necessary to prevent war and protect human life - even if it meant slavery and dispossesssion
    - thus, liberal govt SECURES transferring violence of state of nature to political state through transferring africans, asians, indigenous pppls

## Early Colonialism

### Ireland - first sig. target of english colonialism

- declared 0.5 million acres of land for settlement
- stamped out irish culture, clans
- govt paid bounties for heads of clans
- 19th cent English - suggested irish and other colored descended from apes while english descended from man

### Crusades of 11th century

- conquest of muslims of North Africa and east mediterranean for trade routes into Asia
- domestic crusades against heretics and commoners against poor
- anti-muslim cursades reduced class antogisms bw barons and commoners - united in racist holy war

### Enclosure of commons

- commons - land available o peasents, grazing, wood, fuel, water
- still held by crown but maid available to all
- Enclosure Acts 17th cent. - fenced off commons for crown ‚Üí forced migration, growth of cities, industrial agriculture, degredation of land, creation of proletariat
- opposed by diggers and levellers - invoked Magna Carta to push for their rights

### Workhouse and Factory system

- 1576 workhouse - pre-modern jail, put idle migrants and poor to work
- William Temple and John Locke argued children of poor should be sent to work from age 3-4 as educating idle population would increase unproductivity
- Francis Hutcheson (Scottish philosopher) criticized racial slavery - suggested only use perpetual slavery if idlers cannout be productive after trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù

## John Locke, 1632 - 1704

- helped frame Constitution of Carolina
- secretary council of trade and plantations
- authored Two Treatises of Government - condemns absolute power, sanctions govts and ppl who deprive men of liberties and slavery
- strong advocate for enclosures for private ownership of commons for progress

### Justifies colored slavery/dispossession

- Two Treatises of Govt condemns slavery as a concept but justifies African and Indian slavery
- He states its the liberal citizen‚Äôs RIGHT to kill those who try to bring conflict upon him or his property
- captives taken in a just war gave up their lives to slavery ‚Üí they had ‚Äúchosen‚Äù to give up their lives to slavery
- Locke‚Äôs Fundamental Constitution of South Carolina 1669 - every Carolinian has absolute power over colored slaves, regardless of assimilation
- Locke - promoted depossession of unproductive indigenous ppls - as given the right by european catholic church (doctrine of discovery 1493)

  

## Anti-slavery Liberalism

- Marquis de Condorcet, _Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind_ (1795) - promoted abolition of slavery inequality, imperialism, racism, sexism
- Adam Smith (wealth of nations) - abolition of slavery, but did not believe it was possible under liberal govt (in _Lectures on Jurisprudence_) - turned out true as it was abolished due to war not vote/democracy
- John Stuart Mill (_On Liberty_ 1859) - argued for small govt to protect indiv. rights and was agent of colonialsim under British East India Company (1823-1858)
- Mill defended British imperialism - theres a difference bw barbarians and civilized (barbarians cannot be governed unless vigorous despotism) - believed liberty could not be applied to people who practiced pre-liberty ideals of nature
