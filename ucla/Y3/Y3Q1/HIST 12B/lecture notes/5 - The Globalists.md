## Bretton Woods System, 1944-1971
- established IMF - monitor forex rates and loaning to nations with balance-of-payments (import-export imbalance, major inflation) deficits
- created World Bank - provided funds for reconstruction and economic development of glob south (mostly postwar)
- Bretton Woods pushed for US dollar for int. curr. -> pegged to gold -> everyone relies on the US economy
## Cold War and US Hegemony
- after WW2, US is greatest global econ. and military power
- NATO and Marshall PLan let US invest in foreign markets to increase economic relations and rid communism
- Obstacles to US corporate interests:
	- communism
	- militant organized working class
	- global south: 4th rupture, wanted to rebuild on social democratic or socialist lines
### Fourth Rupture: Revolt of Global South
- background: chinese rev., cuban rev., decolonization, eurocommunism, struggle for welfare state
- goal to transform state into tools for redistribution, justice, worker power, against militarism
- decisions on how to spend global southern countries' money to build their own economies/societies
- glob south defeated -> extractive industries, suppression of unions and democracy -> global market integration and free trade
## The globalists: Neoliberalists
### Central Players
- Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) Founder of Austrian school of Economics; emigrates to U.S. 1940
- Friederich A. von Hayek (1899-1992) Student of Mises at Univ of Vienna; taught at London School of Economics (1929) Univ of Chicago (1950 - 62), Univ of Freiburg, West Germany (1962 - 68), UCLA (1968 – 69), Austria to 1992
- Wilhelm Röpke (1899 – 1966) German, ordoliberal, founder of Geneva School (Institute of International and Development Studies)
- Lionel Robbins (1898 – 1984) British, London School of Economics
- Michael Heilperin (1909 – 1971) Polish-American, Geneva School economist
didn't believe in invisible hand, self-regulating market -> world economy needs protection -> global institutions to protect from glob. south and revolutionists
### Rupture I: WW1 & End of Empire
- war, fall of empires, and war-time measures of control (rationing, price control,  seizing land) -> blurred political and economic domains
- von Mises: role of the govt: to moderate labor not economy - cutdown strikes
- neolibs feared:
	- democratic control of econ. policy
	- self-determination (sovereignty) over economies
	- socialist revolutions (Russia 1917)
### "Solutions"
- ICC (1920) and League of Nations (didnt end up favoring neolibs bc. of support for self-determination of states) to protect capital rights
- league and ICC organized World Econ. Conference 1927 -> tariffs, national sovereignty, and trade unions were barriers to global free trade
- ICC proposes lower wages, cut corporate taxes, suppress labor unions (Mises support of anti-terror laws on labor strikes)
### Birth of Neoliberalism
- Walter Lippmann Colloquium 1938 - book to renovate liberalism
- a hybrid of progressivism and what becomes neoliberalism - still a welfare state for education, public works
### War on Planning
- neolibs called it collectivism like National Socialism (Nazi) - Hayek
- ww2 and fear of germany/socialists -> more nationalist countries across the world
- Hayek's "Road to Serfdom" - argues US and countries planning is them moving to socialism (govt spending is govt plannning)
- Hayek believes inequality is natural, equality emerges from privatization and incentivizes production while welfare state creates dependency
- suggests social mobility is possible under free market - "work harder"
### Neolibs on Decolonization
- promoted decolonization without move to economic nationalism
- against idea that every nation will go down the path of economic development - instead believed the world economy is tied in such a way that corporations have a natural role to privatize and grow: natural division of labor
- absolutely against economic domain subject to democratic rule - suggests democracy prevents free markets
### Killing International Trade Organization
- onme part of Bretton Woods plan that wouldve strenghtened global south
- est. by US in Havana Charter 1948, but global south rejected free trade orthodoxy
- ITO supported this decision to allow new soverignties to impose their own tariffs and regulate their economy for their economic pruposes
- Heilperin and others pushed US to kill ITO through:
	- “International Convention for the Mutual Protection of Private Property Rights in Foreign Countries” (1957) the so- called “Capitalist Magna Carta” – drafted by Hermann Josef Abs, head of Deutche Bank. Required signatory nations to refrain from “direct or indirect illegal interference” with “foreign capital”
- the argument of self-determination, sovereignty's control over economy led to US and other countries use of subversive tactics to protect economy:
	- Iran 1953 overthrow of Mohammed Mosaddegh - for exclusive rights oil fields
	- Guatemala 1954 overthrow Pres Jacobo Arbenz - prmoted labor rights and nationalized agri land -> United Fruit company owned most of this agri land, Pres offered to buy land for listed vbalue, but United Fruit's attorney and connections to CIA led to overthrow
	- Congo 1961 assassination of Patrice Lumumba - Katanga province rich of minerals secedes with US backing, split in leadership -> coup under CIA payroll
	- Brazil 1964 overthrow pres Joao Goulart - for nationaliozing subsidize oil, industry, etc. -> overthrow
