# 4 border governance strategies
- identified by Walia in Border and Rule
1. Exclusion - walls, detention centers, deportation
2. Territorial Diffusion - border enforcement, interdiction, databases
3. Commodified inclusion - temp programs, compliance, deportability
4. Discursive control - racist representations/stories of migrants/refugees
# Biden's Haitian immigration policy
- administration deported more Haitians in 1st month than Trump's entire presidency
- Biden introduced policy preventing asylum seekers applying at US-Mexico border
	- territorial diffusion
- Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program - allowed migrants waiting for visas parole -> Haitians pushed into low wage, dangerous work
	- Commodified inclusion

## US occupation of Haiti
### Pre-occupation
- beginning of WW1, 1914 - US concerned of german influence in Haiti
- US state dept backs American national city bank -> controlled Haitian national bank and govt treasury ->

- imposed forced labor for public works
## Neoliberalization of Haiti
- 1957-86 dictatorship Duvalier family -> elite monopolized wealth
- US supported conditioned on Haiti buying US imports
- US Caribbean Basin Initiative 1983 -> shift subsistence agriculture to exports (intended to increase manufacturing)
- US compels Haiti to free market trade -> American Rice Corp moves in and farmers cant compete
- displaced farmers migrate to cities -> export processing zone of American goods for cheap
- 1986 Duvalier overthrown -> more neoliberal policies, slashed tariffs -> compel US firms to invest
- 1990 Aristide elected -> govt buy rice to reduce imports, and increase min wage -> IMF blocked to keep competitive advantage in production
- International aid contingent on market liberalization
## Migrant Crisis
- economic instability, urban migration, joblessness, political instability - most of which caused by US -> haitians seek asylum in US
- Reagan policy to return all boats or detain then deport
	- these policies are still here under Biden - precedent set by historical prez
- Aristide elected and overthrown by 2004 -> US kidnaps him
- Coup -> Clinton Global Initiative -> created more free zones to increase exports and low wages
## Energy and Mining
### Energy
- PetroCaribe energy agreement - Venezuela agreed to subsidize Haiti w/ oil -> kept fuel prices stable for 10 years
- corrupt govt. stole $3.8 million -> Venezuela econ tanked -> IMF forced Haitian govt to eliminate fuel subsidies for climate change
### Mining
- 1970-s found rare minerals in Haiti valued up to 20$ billion
- 1976 Haiti prohibits mining - people living in the Northern hills where minerals found and mining would devastate
- Post-Aristide govt issued mining permits to US and Canadian firms -> 2017 Haiti works with World Bank to revise law and allow foreign mining
