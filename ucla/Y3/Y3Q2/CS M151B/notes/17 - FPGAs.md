## Lookup Tables
- all combinational circuits are truth table
- we make LUTs by optimizing TTs by having some number of inputs and some number of outputs (like a mux): ![[Pasted image 20240307161606.png]]
- thus sequential logic made by attaching a flip flop
- then the combinational must choose which FF to activate using a MUX e.g., regs
### Registers

- we use island structure: ![[Pasted image 20240307165748.png]]
### DSP blocks
- bc fpgas are slow at arithmetic, we include dediated DSPs: ![[Pasted image 20240307165843.png]]
### Memory

## Memory Interconnect
- because mosst boards are FPGA+arm cpu, there needs to b e a memory interconnect
### Zynq Interface

### AXI Protocol
- Master-slave interconnect:

- done as a 4-burst handshake: ![[Pasted image 20240307170302.png]]
