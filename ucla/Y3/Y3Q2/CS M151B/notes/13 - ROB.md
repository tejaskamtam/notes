## Modern processor pipeline so far
![[Pasted image 20240222163137.png]]
- introduce register renaming to mitigate data dependency
- introduce scoreboard to mitigate RAW hazards
### Dynamic Scheduling
![[Pasted image 20240222161328.png]]
### Limitations of Tomasulo
- Common data Bus (CDB) bottleneck
	- single broadcaast medium
	- sharing aamong functional unit (FU), load/store unit (LSU) and reg file
	- contention bw multiple producers and scalability bw multiple reveivers
	- long latency broadcast
- performance limit by CDB latency - multiple CDB allow multiple in praallel
### Solutions
- split buses: FU, LSU - expensive
- crosbar switch - alo expensive
- point to point connetions
- higher level bus
## Reorder Buffer (ROB)
- reorder instructions
- e.g., reorder to prevent branch prediction 3 stall
### Motivation
- Maintaining program order semantics
	- Ensuring that CPU resources accessible to the application are updated in correct order â€“ (e.g. code debugging)
- Facilitate precise exception handling
	- Ensuring that only the effects of instructions up to the one causing the exception are committed
- Enabling Speculative Execution
	- Supporting the ability to discard the result of speculatively executed instructions (e.g. branch misprediction)
### ROB operations
- Separate architected (ARF) vs physical registers (PRF)
- Track program order of all in-flight instructions
- Enable in-order completion / commit / retirement
- basically, ROB tracks head and tail pointer of regs in instructions
	- operates like a circular linked list
The ROB replaces the PRF:

### Process
#### Issue Stage
- read next instr from instr buffer
- check for structural hazards
	- check reservation station and ROB availability
	- if none, then stall for hazard
- read the RAT
	- find PRF regs given source ARF reg
		- the PRF regs are entries in the ROB
- allocate a new entry in the ROB
	- ROB is sorted llist
	- head points to oldest
	- shift tail down
	- copy ARF info to new entry in ROB - needed for callback/commit
- update RAT
	- if isntr has dest reg
	- use rob dest index
	- rob_idx => RAT->rd
	- then RAT propagates renaming to reservation stations
- dispatch instruction to reservation stations
#### Execute Stage
- after reservation isntrs issued
- wait for validity of source operands
	- operands updated via CDB (common data bus)
- proceed to execution once all operands ready
- arbitrate selection of instr if multiple ready at RS (reservation stations)
- then 1 RS intr is sent to ALU 
#### Write
- broaddcast result on CDB and update RS instrs
	- dont update ARF
- update ROB
	- mark ready bit in rob to signify the instr has completed
- free RS entry
#### Commit
- wait until ROB's head pointer's ready bit is valid
	- then write that back to ARF (update RAT) or update MEM
	- shift head pointer down
	- then wait until that ready bit is done
- what the user sees:
	- although C, F, G all executed before A, A's ready bit in the ROB was not valid until now so it only gets reflected in ARF after it validates![[Pasted image 20240222165922.png]]
	- thus internally it is OOE but user still sees in order exec
- Register renaming using ROB ![[Pasted image 20240222170115.png]]

## Unified RS
- instead of an RS for each add/sub and mult/div, use one unified RS
- arbitration must be done to determine which ALU to go to from the URS
	- ![[Pasted image 20240222171641.png]]
## OoO but not SuperScalar
Because of only 1 shared CDB
- CPU limited to 1 IPC issue
- commit needs to happen >1 IPC to be sustained on superscalar
### Faulty Solution: Dual (N) Issue
- need to check resource availability of RS and ROB for 2 intrs ata time
- then needs to do dual renaming
	- simple unless RAW hazard: ![[Pasted image 20240222172137.png]]
	- if there is RAW the dependency prevents parallel renaming
- then update RS/ROBs in parallel
- thus its expensive to heck for RAW for renaming for more than 4
### Multiple CDB
- what is used today
- but requires RS entry to check operands acros both CDBs' ROB/RAT
- thus for >1 IPC we need multiple read ports on ROB and write on ARF
### Checkpointing
- Create checkpoints of RAT, if one succeeds then delete other chckpoints: ![[Pasted image 20240222173016.png]]
## Handling LD/ST
- handled separately bc cycle count is not deterministic and store is unpredictable
- so we want to limit loads and eensure stores in order
### Solution: queues
- LD/ST queues
- if LD ST is the same address and we observe ordering, then we can use loads from previous loads and stores in order
- memory update in order via ROB
- we determine address through ALU or independent Address Unit
#### Stores
- wait for source operands
- write value into table (queue)
- wait for address
- write address into table
- then exec
- ![[Pasted image 20240222173628.png]]
#### Load
- wait for address
- write to table
- search for earliest LD/ST of same address from queue to avoid another trip
- write value to table
- broadcast value via CDB

### Optimization
#### Forwarding
- Ready load with same address
	- Forward value
- Ready store with same address
	- Forward value
- Pending load with same address
	- Wait
- Pending store with unknown address
	- Wait or speculate (forward value)?
- Otherwise
	- Go to memory
#### Speculation
- When load complete, check the store address
	- If different address, we proceed as usual
	- Otherwise load forwarding
		- Drop the fetched value
		- Doesnâ€™t happen often
- Common solution
