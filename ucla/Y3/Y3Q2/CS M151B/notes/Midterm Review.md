## Latches and Data Forwarding
- latches are actual SR latches and read/write in the same cycle to push data forward to mux - read is combinational so we can do both in same cycle (second half)
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207183922.png]]
- w/o data forwarding requires 2 NOPs so that writeback of first op happens at same cycle as read of next op (writeback happens on posedge - first half, then read happens on second half - combinational)
- w/ data forwarding only 1 NOP needed if theres dependency
- 0 NOPs if it is 2 consecutive ALU ops w/ data forwarding dependency
## Data Forwarding Decision Making
- theres two paths of data forwarding (or backpropagating) but this design is better for signal propogation:
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207184933.png]]
	- M/W latch -> Ex
	- Ex/M latch -> Ex
```cpp
if  (M/W.regWrite == True) && 
	(F/Ex.rs1 == M/W.rd) || (F/Ex.rs2 == M/W.rd)
	{
		dataForward = True;
	}
	^ chek same for Ex/M reg if 2 consecutive adds
```
- `regWrite` is a flag to check whether writing is even occuring
- then check the prev op dest reg `M/W.rd` w/ each of the next op's operand regs `F/Ex.rs1 or F/x.rs2`
- depending on the 2 ops, then check either Ex/M or M/W of first reg![[Pasted image 20240207190007.png]]

## Big Endian vs Little Endian
![[Pasted image 20240207190401.png]]
## Example Question
```
lb x6, 0(x7)
sd x6, 8(x7)

x7 -> 0x10000000 (addr)
0x10000000 -> 0x11_22_33_44_55_66_77_88 (val)

Whats at 8(x7) in BE and LE

BE:
x6 -> 0x00_00_00_11
8(x7) -> 0x00

LE:
x6 -> 0xFF_FF_FF_88
8(x7) -> 0x88
9(x7) -> 0xFF
...
```
- What's at `8(x7)` in:
	- Little Endian? 
	- Big Endian?
