title: 8 - Instruction Pipeline

layout: note

---
## Single Cycle CPU
- single cycle iin series, no parallelism ![[Pasted image 20240130173357.png]]
- simple design, efficient
- but long latency due to longest propagation delay due to signal loss
- latency affects cycle time -> slower CPU time
- solution: multi-cycle pipelining
## Multi-Cycle Processing
- ![[Pasted image 20240130173633.png]]
### Improved Propagation Delay
- ![[Pasted image 20240130173654.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20240130174254.png]]
### Limitations
- hardware undeer utilization -> idle cycles during operations
- solution: pipeline

## Pipelined Processing
- fetch a new instruction each cycle
- PC incremented each cycle
- ![[Pasted image 20240130175938.png]]
### Performance Advantage

### Pipelined Architeture
- ![[Pasted image 20240130175847.png]]
- set next PC and instruction to control at each cycle ![[Pasted image 20240130175859.png]]
### Example Run
- ![[Pasted image 20240130173907.png]]

### Latency
- given base intruction cycle times
	- ![[Pasted image 20240201161553.png]]
- we can find single cycle latency as ![[Pasted image 20240201161616.png]]
- while multi-cycle pipelined is ![[Pasted image 20240201161633.png]]
- although the latency is reduced, there are issues with register dependency
## Pipeline Hazards
### Register Dependency
- pipelined instructions disturb the sequential assumption of execution ![[Pasted image 20240201161802.png]]
### Control Hazards
- control flow dependency b/w instrs
- condition or branch addr may not yet be available to read
### Structural Hazards
- resource sharing b/w instrs - prior instr using a resource needed by next instrs
- specifically about the h/w sharing
- e.g., multi-cycle divide
### Data Hazards
- register sharing b/w instrs
- prior operands req by next instr
- read after write (RAW)
	- an issue bc read and write from same register but cycles apart is an issue ![[Pasted image 20240201162608.png]]
- write after write (WAW) - not an issue
	- 2nd write happens a cycle after so no worries (in-order execution, issue if out of order)![[Pasted image 20240201162705.png]]
- write after read (WAR) - not an issue
	- not an issue due to in-order execution (due to separation in cycles)![[Pasted image 20240201163348.png]]
- read after read (RAR) - not an issue
	- no isue bc both are just reads and pipeline separates reads by >= 1 cycle![[Pasted image 20240201163702.png]]
#### Resolving RAW
- given this RAW example
	- ![[Pasted image 20240201164550.png]]
- naive approach - stallling the pipleline
	- inserting a NOP - i.e., invalid op "bubbles" the register so it is not accessed until after the NOP ![[Pasted image 20240201164719.png]]
- smarter solution - Data Forwarding
## Data Forwarding
- include a wire (set high by a flag indicating RAW) that ties directly to the ALU that reads from the written reg ![[Pasted image 20240201164928.png]]
- then MUX the source to the ALU bw the I1 op or the reg from I0 forward
### Cost
- must add a wire from prev instr state to next state
- also need a mux to select source
- increases propagation delay
### Data Forwarding: Memory ALU
- direct wire is not practical when reading from data due to propagation delay
	- ![[Pasted image 20240201170837.png]]
- in these cases we can add a NOP in between to reset the clock
	- ![[Pasted image 20240201170846.png]]

### General Designs
- we decide the design based on propagation delay; reading from reg is expensive so adding mux is not great; instead we add after ALU bc propagation delay is low
![[Pasted image 20240201170953.png]]
### Selecting the MUX when data forwarding is required
- look ahead to chek if the destination register is the same as the source for the next pipeline stage
- then also look ahead for the other source/destination register of the second command -> LOR these then decide to handle if HI
- then either add a NOP or set data forward select to HI
- we can decide this using a combinational module at the pipeline stage that sends the select immediately before the execution i.e., in design 1, at the green bar after the ALU or the green bar after the Data Memory
