## Point in Polygon
- for ray:
	- draw an infinite ray horizontally to the right of the point in question, odd # of intersections => point in polygon, even => outside polygon
- angle summation:
	- draw vectors from point to all vertices of the polygon, count angles between these drawn vectors
	- if sum = 360 => inside polygon
