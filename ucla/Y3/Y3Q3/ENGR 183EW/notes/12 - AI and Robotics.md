### Notes on Computing Ethics: AI & Robotics

**1. Overview of AI & Robotics Ethics**
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Differentiation between fake and real AI.
- **Recent Achievements**: Significant milestones and advancements in AI technologies.
- **Societal Implications**: Impact of AI on society, jobs, and human roles.
- **The Singularity**: Exploration of the concept, both in fiction and potential reality.

**2. Historical Development of AI**
- **Early Automaton**: Leonardo da Vinci's walking lion (1515).
- **Later Automata**: Clockwork figures and Vaucanson's Digesting Duck (1739).
- **Chess Automaton "The Turk"**: An early example of a fake intelligent machine that was actually controlled by hidden humans.

**3. Milestones in AI Development**
- **1956**: AI named at Dartmouth College.
- **1958**: AI Lab founded at MIT by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky.
- **1965**: ELIZA, an early natural language processing program by Joseph Weizenbaum.
- **1979**: MYCIN, an expert system for medical diagnosis.
- **1997**: IBM's Deep Blue defeats Garry Kasparov at chess.
- **2017**: DeepMind's AlphaZero learns and masters chess and Go in hours.

**4. Current AI Technologies**
- **Neural Networks**: Advanced pattern recognition systems.
- **Semantic Networks**: Understanding and responding to speech.
- **Causal Modeling**: Probabilistic reasoning for decision-making.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms that improve with experience.
- **Generative AI**: Creation of text, images, and other content based on broad knowledge databases.

**5. Societal Implications of AI**
- **Shift in Expertise**: Transition from knowledge workers to AI-based systems.
- **Job Displacement**: Jobs following set rules are most at risk.
- **Remaining Roles for Humans**: Innovation, manual skills, and roles requiring emotional or spiritual engagement.

**6. The Singularity**
- **Kurzweil's Prediction**: AI will surpass human intelligence and capabilities.
- **Fictional Depictions**: Shows like 'Westworld' and films like 'Ex Machina' explore the potential dangers of advanced AI.
- **Real-world Developments**: AI companions, worker robots, helper robots, and independent AI entities.

**7. Ethical Issues in AI Development**
- **Design Challenges**: Issues like the Uncanny Valley where AI closely resembles humans but evokes discomfort.
- **Bias in AI**: Problems with algorithmic bias, such as racial or gender biases in facial recognition and other AI systems.
- **Transparency in Machine Learning**: The need for clear and understandable AI systems, especially in decision-making processes.

**8. Ethical Case Studies**
- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**: Design and ethical challenges specific to narrow AI applications like medical diagnosis and self-driving cars.
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: Ethical concerns about super-intelligent entities and their potential impact on democracy and society.
- **Codes for AI Development**: Various principles and guidelines proposed by institutions and industry leaders to ensure ethical AI development.

**9. The Future of AI Ethics**
- **Institutional Themes**: Privacy, accountability, safety, transparency, fairness, human control, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values.
- **Human-Centered AI**: Emphasis on AI systems that augment and enhance human performance rather than replace it.
- **Government Regulation**: The slow but ongoing efforts to regulate AI to ensure ethical use and development.

### Summary
- **Ethical Takeaway**: The need for careful consideration and regulation of AI technologies to ensure they benefit society and do not exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ethical dilemmas.
- **Human-Centered Approach**: Encouraging the development of AI that supports human creativity, participation, and self-efficacy.
- **Ongoing Challenges**: Addressing biases, ensuring transparency, and preparing for the societal impact of increasingly advanced AI systems.
