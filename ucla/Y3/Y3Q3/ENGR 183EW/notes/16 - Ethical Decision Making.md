### Notes on Ethical Decision Making

**1. The Decision Environment**
- **Naturalistic Decision Making**: 
  - Perceive and build a model of the real world.
  - Use heuristics to select a course of action.
  - Act on the real world.
- **Analytical Decision Making**:
  - Analyze and build a model.
  - Quantitatively select the optimal course of action.
  - Refine and quantify the decision.

**2. Analytical Decision Making**
- **Professional Requirement**:
  - Applicable at working, management, and strategic/policy levels.
- **Conscious Process**:
  - Cognitive performance and meta-cognitive evaluation.
- **Learnable Skill**:
  - Methodologies, experience, practice, feedback, collaboration, and stress management.

**3. Decision Analysis Methodologies**
- **Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis (MAUA)**:
  - Evaluates alternatives based on attributes, attribute values, and their importance.
  - Includes steps to eliminate dominated options and compare monetary equivalents.
  - Utility values and weights are used to make attributes comparable and to find the optimal choice.
  - Sensitivity analysis helps focus on specific attributes.

**4. Decisions with Probabilistic Outcomes**
- **Conditions**: 
  - Several alternatives, probabilistic outcomes, optimal choice among alternatives.
- **Methods**: 
  - Decision Tree: Visualizes decisions, outcomes, probabilities, and expected values.
  - Causal Model/Influence Diagram: Condensed representation of decision trees to evaluate actions and outcomes.

**5. Top-Level Decision Making Examples**
- **Presidents' Decision Styles**:
  - G.W. Bush: Lack of formal sessions to consider alternatives.
  - B. Obama: Data-driven review and meticulous intelligence operations.
  - D. Trump: Intuitive, moment-based decisions.
  - J. Biden: Minimizing conflict, focusing on trust and balance.

**6. Decision Making and Psychology**
- **Influence of Heuristics and Emotions**:
  - Humans are not naturally rational decision-makers.
  - Psychological factors and biases impact decision-making.
- **Prospect Theory**: People's attitudes towards losses and gains are asymmetric.

**7. Ethical Case Studies**
- **Martha Stewart's Decisions**: 
  - Selling stock based on inside information and lying to the SEC led to legal consequences and loss of reputation.
- **Gordon Caplan's Decision**: 
  - Arranged fraudulent SAT scores for his daughter, risking legal and professional repercussions.
- **California Fraud Decision**: 
  - Termination of a fraud detection contract led to significant financial losses.

**8. Group Decision Making**
- **Process**:
  - Groups can be long-standing or ad hoc, multi-disciplinary, local or remote, advisory or final.
  - Structured and aided decision-making procedures are more effective than unstructured ones.

**9. Decision Making Under Stress**
- **Causes of Stress**: 
  - Dangerous environments, risk of injury or death, assessment of task demands, realization of potential bad outcomes.
- **Responses to Stress**: 
  - Physiological and psychological responses can narrow attention and reduce problem-solving capacity.
- **Strategies**: 
  - Recognize stress levels, use structured procedures, and productively channel stress energy.

**10. Ethical Decision Making Summary**
- **Controlling Factor**:
  - Ethics should trump economics, personal values, and organizational culture.
- **Benefit and Cost Factors**:
  - Consideration of negative consequences and ethical implications.
- **Personal Action**:
  - Being ethical involves standing for values and taking actions that align with them.

### Summary
- **Ethical Takeaway**: 
  - Ethical decision-making requires a balance of analytical methods, awareness of psychological biases, and a strong ethical framework.
- **Role of Individuals and Organizations**: 
  - Engineers and decision-makers should integrate ethical considerations into their processes and promote a culture of ethical decision-making.
