### Notes on Computing Ethics: Simulation & Gaming

**1. Overview of Computing Ethics**
- **Societal and Personal Impacts**: Includes databases, surveillance, internet connectivity, AI, robotics, simulation, and gaming.
- **Profound Societal and Ethical Implications**: Highlights the significant effects of computing technology on society.

**2. Historical Timeline of Computing**
- **Ancient Mechanisms**: Antikythera Mechanism (~70-60 BCE), early analog computers.
- **Mechanical Calculators**: Chinese and Roman abacuses (~100 CE), Pascaline Calculator (1642), Stepped Reckoner (1673).
- **Modern Computer Configurations**: Babbage's Analytical Engine (1820s), Hollerith Tabulating Machine (1890).
- **Growth of Computing Power**: Development from WWII Ultra Machines to modern integrated circuits and quantum computing.

**3. Ethical Case 1: Simulation**
- **Applications**: Scientific simulations (particle physics, DNA, weather, economics), industrial uses (CAD/CAM, 3D graphics), animation, training (flight, surgery, digital humans).
- **Key Issues**: Believability, transparency, accuracy. Problems with deep fakes and their impact on trust and authenticity.

**4. Ethical Case 2: Gaming**
- **Beginnings**: Early successes like 'Pong' (1972) and 'Battlezone' (1980).
- **Role Playing Implications**: Development of games from single-player shooters to MMOGs and virtual communities.
- **Game Developers' Ethical Code**: International Game Developers Association principles but lack of statements on violence, misogyny, racism, or ethics in game contents.
- **Game Players' Ethics and Morality**: Influence of games on real-world behavior, ethical dilemmas in gaming, legal issues, and community responses (e.g., Gamergate).

**5. Key Ethical Issues in Gaming**
- **Pros and Cons of Violent Games**: Mixed research on the impact of violent games on aggression and real-world behavior.
- **Training and Recruitment**: Use of combat games by the military for recruitment and training.
- **Legal and Societal Implications**: Courts' defense of gaming under the First Amendment, societal debates on the ethical content of games.
- **Deep Fakes in Gaming and Society**: Issues with digital humans and AI-generated content, impact on stock markets and public trust.

**6. New Directions and Technologies in Computing**
- **State-of-the-Art CPU**: NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and its applications in AI and data centers.
- **Quantum Computing**: Basics of qubits, entanglement, and quantum circuits. Potential for significantly faster problem-solving.
- **Laws of Computing Growth**: Moore's Law and Kurzweilâ€™s Law of Accelerating Returns predicting continued exponential growth in computational power.

### Summary
- **Ethical Takeaway**: Emphasis on the responsibility of game designers and producers to advance constructive ethical positions in their games.
- **Simulation-Based Games**: Can enhance society if designed with ethical considerations in mind.
- **Deep Fakes**: Need for advanced AI to help identify and mitigate the impact of deep fakes on society.

These notes summarize the key points covered in the slides from the undergraduate engineering ethics class on computing ethics, simulation, and gaming.
