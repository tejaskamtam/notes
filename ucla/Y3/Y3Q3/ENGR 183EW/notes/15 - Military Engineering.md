### Notes on Military Engineering Ethics

**1. Overview of Military Engineering Ethics**
- **Defense Establishment**: 
  - Military-Industrial Complex: Eisenhower's warning about the influence of military and industry.
  - Departments: DoD and DHS roles.
- **Defense Engineering Environment**:
  - Budgets and expenditures.
  - Current policy drivers.
  - Technical thrusts.

**2. Military-Industrial Complex**
- **Eisenhower's Farewell Address (1961)**: Warning about the potential for unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex.
- **Current Structure**: Includes the President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Director of National Intelligence, Secretary of Homeland Security, National Security Council, and Vice President.

**3. U.S. Military Establishment**
- **Organization**: President and key defense officials, including Joint Chiefs of Staff and various defense agencies.
- **Pentagon**: Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.

**4. Post 9/11 Department Formation**
- **Mission**: Protect against terrorist attacks, analyze threats, guard borders and infrastructure, coordinate emergency response, and enhance public services.
- **R&D Priorities**: Information, infrastructure, surveillance, and security.

**5. U.S. Defense Expenditures**
- **Historical Context**: Spending trends from Korea, Vietnam, Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
- **Recent Budgets**: Increased during the Trump and Biden administrations, with FY2024 over $830 billion.

**6. Comparison of Defense Budgets and Personnel**
- **U.S. vs. Other Militaries**: Defense spending and active military personnel comparisons.
- **Top Defense Contractors**: Major companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and Raytheon.

**7. DoD's Current Policy Drivers**
- **Threats**:
  - Conventional: Regional conflicts, rogue states.
  - Asymmetrical: Terrorist movements, insurgent forces.
- **Strategic and Tactical Requirements**: Stable governments, diverse force composition, minimal casualties, cultural considerations, social media use, advanced technologies.

**8. DoD's Technology Trusts**
- **Focus Areas**: Netcentric warfare, asymmetric threats, information operations, missile and satellite defense, electronic warfare, remote targeting, unmanned and autonomous systems.

**9. Ethical Analysis of Warfare**
- **Laws of War (LoW)**: Military necessities, avoidance of unnecessary suffering, distinction and discrimination, proportionality, honor.
- **Purpose of Just Wars**: National defense, power projection, ally support, humanitarian intervention, regime change, preventive/preemptive actions.

**10. Conduct and Consequences of Just Wars**
- **Collateral Damage**: Importance and avoidability.
- **Weapons of Mass Destruction**: Acquisition and use conditions.
- **Terror and Suicide Bombing**: Moral considerations.
- **Targeted Assassination and Treatment of Prisoners**: Legal status, conditions, and torture justification.

**11. Military Technologies**
- **Robotics**: Humanoid, drones, autonomous systems.
- **Unmanned Vehicles**: Ground, ocean, aerial (UAVs), small UAVs, and nano drones.
- **Remote Targeting**: Origins, scaling, public reaction, and operator stress.

**12. Ethical Issues with Autonomous Lethal Weapons (LAWS)**
- **Asimov's Laws of Robotics**: Ethical considerations and limitations in military contexts.
- **Development and Use**: Ethical standards, autonomy levels, programmed values, and human-robot coexistence.
- **Ethical Decision Models**: Bayesian models for ethical strike decisions.

**13. Societal Reactions to War**
- **Public Opinion**: Survey data on military efforts and decisions.
- **Media and Cultural Representations**: Influence of movies and literature on public perception of war.

**14. Final Thoughts**
- **Personal Decision**: Participation in military technology as an individual choice.
- **Continued Conversation**: Importance of ethical considerations in military decisions and public awareness.

### Summary
- **Ethical Takeaway**: The necessity for ethical guidelines and regulations in military engineering, particularly concerning the development and deployment of autonomous lethal weapons.
- **Role of Engineers**: Ensuring that military technologies are developed and used responsibly, with attention to ethical standards and human values.
