### Notes on Computing Ethics: Databases & Surveillance

**1. Overview of Database & Privacy Issues**
- **Societal Issues**: Availability, privacy, and security of internet information.
  - Key questions: What do you want others to know? What do you not want others to know? Is there a right to personal privacy?
  - Concerns: What do others already know about you? What are others doing with your information? Is it for private gain or the common good?
  - Protection: What protections are available for individuals and information?

**2. Personal Information: Benefits and Risks**
- **Good News**:
  - Gigantic amount of information available.
  - Ultra-easy access.
  - Many positive uses.
- **Bad News**:
  - Difficult to control.
  - Many chances for abuse and misuse.

**3. Example: Building an eDossier**
- Sources: Google, Bing, MSN, Zabasearch, Whitepages, Spokeo, Zillow, Trulia, Redfin.
- Types of information: Criminal record, lawsuits, judgments, tax liens, bankruptcies, employment, education, memberships, publications, news events, contact info, home size and value, neighborhood.

**4. Ethical Case 1: Database Use and Abuse**
- **Creation**: Everyday transactions, specialized transactions, internet activity, emailing and texting.
- **Ownership**: Government, businesses, institutions, individuals.
- **Uses**: Records & statistics, information gathering, strategic decision making.
- **Technologies**: Acquisition, security, integration, analysis.
- **Concerns**: Messages, documents, images, videos, web pages, web clicks.

**5. Data Acquisition Technologies**
- **Older Technologies**: Written transactions, photographs, recordings, movies.
- **Newer Technologies**: Digital computer & phone data, files, emails, texts, messages, DNA, phone/GPS, credit card, license plate, facial recognition.
- **Interconnection and Distribution**: Networks of companies, internet users, bloggers, hackers, government agencies.

**6. Chances for Abuse and Misuse**
- **Privacy Concerns**: Medical records, sexual identity, arrests, bankruptcies, memberships, personal communications.
- **Piracy Concerns**: Secrets, intellectual property, identities, site functionality.

**7. User Authentication and Biometric Identification**
- **Protection Modalities**: Card, key, PIN, password, biometrics (fingerprint, handprint, iris/retinal pattern, facial recognition, signature, gait).

**8. Cyberspace Invasions**
- **Examples**: Hackers breaching protected servers, ransom payments, personal data theft.

**9. Big Data Complications**
- **Definition**: Totality of information about a person’s finances, memberships, activities, interests.
- **Uses**: Political campaigns, marketing research, public opinion gauging, government surveillance.
- **Concerns**: Personal data sold to businesses and organizations, manipulation via targeted messages and fear tactics.

**10. Ethical Case 2: Government Surveillance**
- **Data Acquisition**: Broadly defined population data vs. specific individual or group data for defined purposes (e.g., past illegal activities, prevention of future illegal actions, anticipating dangerous behavior).
- **Constitutional Protection**: 4th Amendment (security in persons, houses, papers, effects), 5th Amendment (protection against self-incrimination, due process).
- **Privacy Expectation**: Historical privacy vs. internet age privacy.

**11. Surveillance Examples**
- **Inside/Outside Your House**: Visible energy, infrared energy, radar, voice assistants.
- **Drones and Privacy**: Concerns about unique vantage points and low-flying capabilities violating visual privacy.
- **Real People Listening**: Concerns about devices like Alexa, Google, Siri always being on and recording.

**12. Trust in Government**
- **Senator Frank Church’s Warning**: Technological capacity of the intelligence community could enable total tyranny if misused.
- **Privacy and Security**: Emphasis on laws, supervision, and transparency to prevent potential harm.

**13. Ethical Case 3: Right to Information**
- **China’s Position**: Limiting access to databases and demanding restrictions on information.
- **Business vs. Ethics**: Companies weighing ethical ideals against market demands.
- **Regulation**: Possible US Congress intervention to prevent restrictions and promote ethical practices.

### Summary
- **Ethical Takeaway**: The need for comprehensive regulations and ethical practices to balance privacy, security, and access to information.
- **Role of Engineers**: Importance of engineers in promoting responsible use of technology and protecting individual privacy through advanced methods like encryption.
