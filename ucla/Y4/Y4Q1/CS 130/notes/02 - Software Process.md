# Software process Models
- a SW process is a set of tasks -> software
- a SW process model, is an abstraction of a process (i.e. a tempalte)
- includes:
- Waterfall model - V-model
- Incremental model - RAD model
- Iterative model - Spiral model
- Agile Model - SCRUM
## Waterfall model

### V-model

## Incremental Model

### RAD Model - Rapid Application Development

## Iterative Model

### Spiral Model

## Agile Model
![[Pasted image 20241003125818.png]]
- individual interactions - processes/tools
- working software - robust docs
- customer input - contract negotiation
- responding to change - planned changes
### Scrum model

- scrum roles ![[Pasted image 20241003130006.png]]
- product owner - represents stakeholders, ROI responsible, accepts/rejects results, manages backlog, prioritizes functionalities (PM)
- product backlog - fluid, list of prioritized user stories ad the sprints in which they are to be developed
	- ![[Pasted image 20241003130159.png]]
- user stories - spec reqs from user prespective (first person)
	- describes marginal value of the proposed req, 
	- acceptance criteria, 
	- must be 1-sprint time, 
	- can be aggregated into an **epic** (lasts multiple sprints), 
	- can be decomposed into multiple tasks
- Epic -> Story -> Task
	- ![[Pasted image 20241003130417.png]]
- Sprints - multi-week high velocity development cycles
	- sprint planning - PM/PO prioritizes stories, dev team selects stories for the sprint and splits into tasks, both collectively define spring goal and sprint backlog
	- handled by scrum master - removes obstacles/interference, keeps focus on sprint goals, manages collaboration of dev team
	- sprint backlog usually kanban
	- a burndown chart helps to visualize time and trend for task completion
		- ![[Pasted image 20241003131830.png]]
	- daily standup - just that, discuss blockers, scrum master helps mitigate
	- sprint review - end of sprint results and demo new features, informal
	- sprint retro - accolades, what worked well, what can be better
