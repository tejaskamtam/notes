## Question 1 - PPP Byte Stuffing
First, to make visualizing the bytes easier, we can
convert the binary representations to hex:
```python
Fag (F) = 0b01111110 = 0x7e
Escape (E) = 0b01111101 = 0x7d
Mask (M) = 0b00100000 = 0x20

XOR(F,M) = 0b01011110 = 0x5e # when F occurs replace w/: 0x7d5e
XOR(E,M) = 0b01011101 = 0x5d # when E occurs replace w/: 0x7d5d
```

### Q1 - Resulting Frame
Given sender datagram:
```python
source_datagram = 0b01111101_01111101_01111110_01111110 = 0x7d_7d_7e_7e
```

PPP Byte stuffing results in the modified frame:
```python
PP_frame_struct = <F>_<E^M>_<E^M>_<F^M>_<F^M>_<F>
PPP_frame = 0x7e_7d5d_7d5d_7d5e_7d5e_7e
= 0b01111110_01111101_01011101_01111101_01011101_01111101_01011110_01111101_01011110_01111110
```

### Q2 - Byte vs Bit Stuffing
Byte stuffing seems to be easier for software than bit
stuffing because byte stuffing allows us to work with hex
and mod 2 arithmetic at word/byte level. Most memory and
data in software are stored as hex, and trying to
manipulate a single bit within a byte can be expensive
compared to running operations on hex.

### Q3 - Overhead
Considering only the flag byte and not possible escape
bytes, HDLC has a $1 / 32$ chance of the flag appearing in any
5-bit pattern in the datagram. On the other hand, PPP has
a $1 / 256$ chance of the flag appearing in any 1-byte pattern
in the datagram. This is roughly a 0.4% overhead for bit
stuffing, given uniformly random bytes in the datagram.

### Q4 - Worst Case

In HDLC, we only bit stuff 0s after every sequence of fve
1s. Because the flag is six 1s contained in 2 0s, there
are no escape characters as false flags cannot occur with
stuffng every 5-bits. So for every 5-bit sequence of 1s,
we stuff at most 1 bits. This is an overhead of $1 / 5 = 20 \%$.
This holds for any sequence of groups of fve 1s, e.g., 10
1s requires 2 stuffed 0s which is also a 20% overhead.
This is the worst case  when all 5-bit groups in the
datagram are 1s.


In PPP, we escape false flags with byte stuffng. This
effectively doubles the number of bits for each occurrence of the false flag (the same is true for every occurrence of a false escape). In the worst case, all bytes are either flags or escapes, in which case we double the overall length of the datagram by escaping. This results in a worst case overhead of $100 \%$.

## Question 2 - Error Recovery

### Q1 - STATUS Packets

The `STATUS` packet is required to verify that the receiver
has received all packets. Suppose there is no `STATUS`
packet sent. In the given example, suppose the receiver
receives packet 1, loses packet 2, and loses packet 3. The receiver doesn't know that the sequence has ended without
a `STATUS` packet, so does not send a NACK. This means the
receiver assumes only 1 packet was intended and the sender
assumes the receiver has received all 3 packets because no
NACK was sent preemptively.
Thus, a STATUS packet is required to signify the end of a
sequence of packets  to tell the sender how many
packets the receiver has successfully received.

Q2 - Timers

The source of ambiguity in the given error recovery
example is how the sender can be informed about how many
packets the receiver has successfully received. In the
example, lost/erroneous packets in the middle of the
sequence are already successfully handled as the receiver
can distinguish packet ids and send an immediate NACK
(with last received packet ID) when a future packet is
detected e.g., 1 received, 2 lost, 3 received. The only


issue now, is ensuring the last packet is received. The
only way to do so is by sending a STATUS packet (due to
the argument in Q1). Therefore, implementing a timer will
ensure that a STATUS packet is sent at the end of the
packet sequence which will ultimately notify the sender of
how many packets of the sequence the receiver has
successfully received (the core issue). The sender can
then decide to retransmit packets. So, the timer ensure
the STATUS is sent, and the STATUS ensures all packets
have been received.

Q3 - Timer Conditions

The frst criteria for the timer is that the timer must
expire after the last packet (suppose this is packet no.
3) is sent. In this case there are 2 outcomes, either the
receiver has already received the last packet, then it
will correctly NACK 3, or the packet is in transmit, in
which case the receiver will NACK 2 and the timer must be
restarted and the sender must again send SEQ 3, wait for
the timer to expire, send status, then receive the correct
NACK 3.
The second criteria is that the timer must be restarted
whenever a preemptive NACK is received. This indicates a
lost packet, so the sender must retransmit all packets
from the "Nacked" packet. In this situation, the new
(restarted) timer must again expire after the last packet
in the sequence.

Q4 - Loss Latency

Suppose the roundtrip time is given as _RTT_ = 2 Ã— _OWT_
where _OWT_ is the oneway time and the STATUS TIMER is _ST_.
The process for sending a single packet D that is frst
lost is as follows:


```
Question 3 - CRC
```
```
Q1 - Debugging
```
```
Firstly, there is an error in the compute_crc function
where the added padding in the line:
```
```
This line adds generator_length padding but should be
adding only generator_length-1 padding.
Now the next error is in the binary division function
bin_div. Specifcally, the following line:
```
1. Start timer
2. Send D : + _OWT_
3. Timer ends : + _ST_
4. STATUS sent : + _OWT_
5. NACK 0 received : + _OWT_
6. Start timer
7. Retransmit D : + _OWT_
8. Timer ends : + _ST_
9. STATUS sent : + _OWT_
10. NACK D received : + _OWT_
Now, if we assume that _ST_ >> _OWT_ , we get the following
total latency for the example:
Latency= _ST_ + _OWT_ + _OWT_ + _ST_ + _OWT_ + _OWT_ = 2 _ST_ + 2 _RTT_

```
padded_message = message_bin + '0' * (generator_length)
```
```
temp = bin(int(temp, 2 ) ^ int(divisor, 2 ))
[ 2 ].zfll(divisor_length)
```

This line uses zfll to prepend 0s until the binary value
is of length divisor_length. This is not what we want to
happen as what we want to do is pull down values from the
dividend down and append them to the remainder if there
are not enough bits to perform binary division again
(given there are still bits to the right in the dividend).
The next error, also in the bin_div function is the
following lines:

These lines, frstly disregard the MSB of the remainder,
which we want to keep for the next iteration of division
(especially so in the case where the remainder is the same
length as the divisor). Secondly, this code only brings
down a single value to the right of the remainder from the
dividend. Instead, we should be bringing down as many
values from the dividend as possible until the number of
bits in the modifed remainder is as large as the divisor
(given there are bits to the right in the dividend
available to "pull down"). This should make much more
sense in the images below.

Q2 - Incorrect CRC

```
temp = temp[ 1 ]
if len(dividend) > divisor_length:
temp += dividend[divisor_length]
dividend = dividend[ 1 ]
```

The incorrect CRC printed is 011.

Q3 - Correct CRC

The correct CRC should be 001 as we show it is validated
by the receiver. Note, here we also pad only with the


correct/required number of bits: len(generator)-1.
