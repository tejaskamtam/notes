## Key Definitions

**Electric Charge (EC)** - a property of a particle that causes it to experience a force in the proximity of other electrically charged particles

- **Electromagnetic (EM) Force** - the force associated with electric charges
- **Coulombs [$C$]** - measure of EC
- $e^-\approx-1.602\times10^{-19}\space C$

**Conductors** - conduct due to free valence electrons

**Insulators** - insulate due to lack of free electrons

## Properties of Electric Charge

- **Electromagnetic Force** - all EC exerts a force on all other EC
- **Conservation of Electric Charge** - EC is not created/de4stroyed
- **Electric Charge is Quantized** - EC are determined in increments: integer multiples of the charged particle (e$^-$, p$^+$, etc.)
