## Key Definitions

**Gauss' Law** - The **electric flux** through any _closed surface_ is proportional to the enclosed [[Electric Charge]]

**Electric Flux** - the amount of [[Electric Fields]] passing through a surface

---

## Electric Flux

Given by:

##### $$\Phi_E=\int_S\vec E \cdot d\vec A=\int_S E\cos \theta\space dA$$

Such that, given the normal vector to the surface:

##### $$\vec A = A\vec n$$

and, $\theta$ is the angle between the electric field and the normal vector, $\vec n$, to the surface

---

## Gauss' Law

Given by:

##### $$\Phi=\oint_S\vec E \cdot d\vec A = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\int dq$$

where $Q_{enc}$ is the total [[Electric Charge]] enclosed by the surface $S$
We can find the total charge using [[Electric Fields#Charge Density]]
