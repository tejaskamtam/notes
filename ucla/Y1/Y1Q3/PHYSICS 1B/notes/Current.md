## Key Definitions

**Electric Current** - flow of [[Electric Charge]] through a medium

**Volume charge density** - current per unit area

---

## Current

Defined as

##### $$I=\frac{dQ}{dt}\approx\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} [A]$$

The unit of current is the **Ampere**:

###### $$1 A = 1\frac C s$$

---

## Direction of Current

Current is defined by the flow of positive charge:

###### $$I = \frac{d(+q)}{dt}$$

However, in a conducting wire, the negatively charged electrons are moving.

Thus, current flowing through a wire actually means the _negative_ flow of electrons through a wire:

### Drift Velocity

Free moving electrons collide with other electrons and atoms.
The average velocity of free charges is called the drift velocity, $v_d$, and it is the direction opposite to the electric field for the electrons.

Collisions transfer energy to the conductor, thus requiring a constant supply of energy to maintain a steady current:

##### $$I=\frac{dQ}{dt}=n|q|v_dA$$

## Mechanics of Current

On the subatomic level, electrons bounce around within a conducting wire at the order of $10^6 m/s$, but the thermal motion of electrons is random and creates no net current.

To produce non-trivial current through a wire, we need to apply an [[Electric Fields]] which will exert a net force on the charges by [[Coulomb's Law]]

The average velocity of the charges is the drift velocity and is about $10^{-4}m/s$

## Current Density

**Volume charge density** - current per unit area:

##### $$J=\frac{dI}{dA}$$

Alternatively, given drift velocity:

##### $$\vec J=n|q|\vec v_d$$
