## Key Definitions

**Capacitor** - 2 conductors of equal but opposite [[Electric Charge]] separated by a distance (used to store charge in an electric field)

- **Anode** - positive plate
- **Cathode** - negative plate

**Capacitance** - the ratio of electric charge stored to difference in [[Electric Potential]]:

##### $$C=\frac Q V [F]$$

Where $Q$ is the charge on the positive conductor and $V$ is the potential difference between conductors

---

## Properties of Conductors

1. $E=0$ inside a conductor
2. $\rho=0$ inside a conductor
3. Any net charge lies on the surface of a conductor
4. A conductor is an equipotential
5. $E$ is perpendicular to the surface outside the conductor

---

## Properties of Capacitance

1. Capacitance is purely a geometric quantity determined by size, shape, and separation of the 2 conductors
2. Units of capacitance are **farads, $F$**
3. Charge $Q$ is considered the charge on the _positive_ conductor
4. Electric potential $V$ is of the _positive_ conductor
5. Capacitance is always a positive quantity

## Geometric Capacitances

### Sphere

Capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius $R$:

##### $$C=\frac Q V=4\pi\epsilon_0R=\frac R {k_e} [F]$$

Where $k_e\approx 9\times 10^9$

### Parallel Plate Capacitor

Capacitance of two conducting plates of area $A$ and separation $d$:

##### $$C=\frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}[F]$$

Given that

###### $$V = Ed = \frac{\sigma d}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{Qd}{\epsilon_0 A}$$

## Capacitors

### Energy

The electrical energy stored in a _charged capacitor_:

##### $$U=\frac 1 2QV=\frac 1 2\frac{Q^2}{C}=\frac 1 2CV^2$$

Energy stored in the _electric field_:

##### $$\frac{U}{\text{Vol}}=\frac{E^2}{2\epsilon_0}$$

### Discharging

Energy stored in capacitors can be released very quickly resulting in higher **power**

E.g. camera flash, lasers, spark-plugs, _defibrillators_

### In Series

Series connections result in lower capacitance:

##### $$\frac 1 {C_{eq}}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{C_i}$$

### In Parallel

Parallel connections increase capacitance:

##### $$C_{eq}=\sum_{i=1}^nC_i$$
