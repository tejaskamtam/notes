## Key Definitions

**Resistivity** - a measure of resistance to flow of current within a material

- Good conductors have lower resistivity
- Good insulators have higher resistivity

**Electrical Resistance** - a measure of resistance to flow of current through a circuit

## Ohm's Law

[[Current#Current Density]], $\vec J$, depends on the applied [[Electric Fields]]

For linear materials the current density is proportional to the electric field given by **Ohm's Law**:

##### $$\vec E=\rho\vec J$$

Where $\rho$ is the **resistivity** of the material given by:

##### $$\rho = \frac{E}{J}$$

### Resistance (Alternate Form)

In the context of total current passing through a circuit, resistivity depends on shape/size and type of material, collectively defined as **electrical resistance**:

##### $$R=\frac{\rho L}{A}$$

Given [[Electric Potential]]:

##### $$V=IR$$

## Temperature Dependance

Resistivity varies with many factors, but nearly all metallic conductors' resistivity correlates with temperature:

##### $$\rho(T)=\rho_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)]$$

Where $\rho_0$ is a reference resistivity at temperature $T_0$ known as the **temperature coefficient of resistivity**

### Resistance (Alternate Form)

Similarly, temperature dependance is given by:

##### $$R(T)=R_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)]$$
