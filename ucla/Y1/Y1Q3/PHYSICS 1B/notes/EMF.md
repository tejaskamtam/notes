## Key Definitions

**DC Circuit** - [[Circuits]] with one-directional flow of charge

**Electromotive Force (EMF)** - the extra force in a battery (usually from chemical energy) required to push [[Electric Charge]]

- represented as the "battery" symbol in a circuit

**Ideal Battery** - a battery with an internal resistance of 0

## EMF

Defined as the potential:

##### $$\varepsilon = \int \vec f_s \cdot d\vec l$$

Where

###### $$\vec f_s = \frac{\vec F_s}{q} \left [\frac N C\right]$$

Such that $\vec F_s$ is the actual force in EMF

### Power in a Battery

Power supplied by a battery is defined as

##### $$P=IV=I\varepsilon$$

### EMF in a Battery

The total force acting on a charge in a battery is defined as:

##### $$\vec F_{net} = q(\vec E + \vec f_s)$$

### EMF in a Circuit

Due to the internal resistivity of a battery, $r$:

##### $$\varepsilon = I(R+r)$$

Thus,

###### $$I=\frac{\varepsilon}{R+r}$$

Therefore, [[Resistance#Ohm's Law]] can be written as:

##### $$V_{battery}=IR=\varepsilon-Ir$$

## Circuits

### Open Circuits

If external [[Resistance]] is taken to infinity in a circuit, we can use **EMF** to find:

###### $$I=0$$

Thus

##### $$V_{battery}=\varepsilon-0=\varepsilon$$

I.e. a circuit with infinite external resistance causes current to go to 0 which is just like an open circuit, so the [[Electric Potential]] of the battery is itself

### Short Circuit

If resistance goes to 0, current is described as

###### $$I_{max}=\frac{\varepsilon}{r}$$

Because internal resistance is small, it is equivalent to the EMF, thus

##### $$V=\varepsilon-\varepsilon=0$$

This is a shorted circuit, so the power is given as

##### $$P_{max}=\frac{\epsilon^2}{r}$$
