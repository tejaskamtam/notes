## Key Definitions

**Dielectrics** - insulating materials, used between plates of [[Capacitors]]

---

## Polarization

Insulators in an electric field polarize due to attraction between external charges and the atomic structure of the insulator:

## Dielectrics

Molecules of the insulating material between plates of a capacitor polarize (due to the electric field).

This attracts more charge on the (negative) plate (**cathode**).

Thus, increasing the _capacitance_ while decreasing _electric field strength_, which results in smaller **voltage** between the plates:

##### $$V=Ed=\frac{E_0}{k}d$$

Where k is a factor to quantify a dielectric which increases the capacitance of a capacitor:

##### $$C=\frac Q V \therefore C=kC_0$$
