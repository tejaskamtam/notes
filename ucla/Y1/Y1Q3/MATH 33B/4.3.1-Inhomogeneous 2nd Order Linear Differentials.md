---

## Key Definitions
**Inhomogeneous Equations** - Eq. w/ forcing term $g(t) \not =0$
I.e. dealing with [[4.2-Homogenous 2nd Order Linear]] when $\not = 0$ of form:
##### $$y''+py'+qy=g(t)$$

---

## General Solution for Constant Coefficients
If $y_p$ is a particular solution to the inhomogeneous eq. $y''+py'+qy=g(t)$ and $y_1,y_2$ form a fundamental set of solutions to the homogeneous eq. $y''+py'+qy=0$, then the general solution is:
##### $$y(t;C_1,C_2)=C_1y_1(t)+C_2y_2(t)+y_p(t)$$

Use [[4.3.2-Method of Undetermined Coefficients]] to find a particular solution if $p,q$ are constant
Use [[4.4-Variation of Parameter]] otherwise
