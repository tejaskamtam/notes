## Preface
Before reading this article, I encourage you to read [my disclaimer](https://blog.tejaskamtam.com/blog/00%20disclaimer/), now more than ever. The content of this post is atypical of what I generally encourage, but it's necessary, to begin with the reason for why we make decisions. Only from there can we understand what motivates our choices and how this makes us uniquely human. Much of the content may seem unrealistic, but I ask you to humor me.

## Sentience Isolation
René Descartes proposed this solution in his treatise _Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences_ for the fundamental question of the proof of *our* "consciously" existence (note this is orthogonal to proof for our corporeal existence): "I think, therefore, I am." As you will see, this is quite strong evidence for the existence of each individual and unique conscience. I propose the extended proof of this is because every one of us is (no better explained than) the **protagonist** of our stories. From birth, we only ever experience life from our perspective. On the surface, this claim is relatively superficial. We each understand this, but I implore you to question if you can verify this for others. I've pondered this, and the conclusion I've come to is "no." I can't imagine the distinct, individual chain of thought that occurs by experiencing life from another person's perspective - the one thing that uniquely makes each our own person. In this individuality, I find isolation.

There is a vast sea of personalities (which I would, in this context, define as the unique patterns in how a person thinks - *method*) between each person. There may very well be a finite set of shared beliefs, values, and methods as we seem to, on occasion, understand others' thought processes; however, in general, there are immeasurably more of these mutually exclusive "chains of thought" (thought processes) that occur inside each of our conscience. The salient notion in this realization is that no one on earth can entirely and adequately understand our complex "personality." We are forever imprisoned in our minds with no meaningful escape, and in this fact, we are indeed alone.

## Corporeal Isolation
Now, the alternatives arise: "If no one can ever *truly* understand me, at least I can confide in others?" However, I argue it isn't that simple. Corporeal existence may be, in fact, an illusion as well. After all, the ultimatum is that we are truly alone.


### Cosmological Isolation
First, I'd like to tackle cosmological isolation, as it's much more straightforward to reason about than existential isolation. The simplest suggestion for our isolation on a little floating rock orbiting a mildly bright sphere in the corner of our galaxy is the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox).

Briefly, Enrico Fermi suggested the following chain of thought to explain the discrepancy between the high probability (and frequency, by consequence) of intelligent, advanced, extraterrestrial life yet the lack of conclusive evidence:

> - There are billions of stars in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") similar to the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").
> - With high probability, some of these stars have Earth-like planets in a [circumstellar habitable zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone "Circumstellar habitable zone").
> - Many of these stars, hence their planets, are much older than the Sun. If Earth-like planets are typical, some may have developed [intelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence "Human intelligence") life long ago.
> - Some of these [civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") may have developed [interstellar travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel "Interstellar travel"), a step humans are investigating now.
> - Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years.
> - Since many of the Sun-like stars are billions of years older than the Sun, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations, or at least their probes.
> - However, there is no convincing evidence that this has happened.

The lack of convincing evidence suggests out of all the probable events, only Earth had spawned life and, as a result, (relatively) intelligent, rational human beings. There are many proposed reasons for this, including the idea of multiple obstacles/blockades preventing other Earth-like planets from developing intelligent life (one of these being that evolution is significantly more complex and correspondingly orders more unlikely than we [currently imagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_biological_complexity)). If you are more of a visual learner, Kurzgesagt has uploaded fantastic videos [explaining the Fermi paradox](https://youtu.be/sNhhvQGsMEc?si=OvWJcMQq68ctN-_W) and [possible solutions](https://youtu.be/1fQkVqno-uI?si=Cati4T71WtKyuPhP). This stands to reckon that we are likely cosmologically alone.

### Ontological Isolation
Logic derived from the likelihood of events by the probability of their occurrence, like the example above, opens the doors for many skeptical yet probable refutations to our ontological existence.

"Erasaphobia" is the (unofficial) term for the irrational fear of living in an inescapable simulation. However, this fear of digital simulation may not be as irrational as you may think. With current technology, we are already capable of near-perfectly simulating physics at every strata and adequately at long time periods (usually by accelerating time in the simulation). Artificial Intelligence has, likewise, revolutionized our capability to simulate intelligent beings. The projected timelines to achieving artificial general intelligence (and likewise artificial sentience) are shrinking; it won't be long until we are able to perfectly simulate long. Now consider this took our species only about 25,000 years from inception. If this is possible (which it very likely appear to be), consider the following:
- The "real" world, existing in the "real" universe achieves the capability to simulate the universe itself at 10,000x their rate of time
- This simulated world then becomes capable of simulating artificial life themselves, again at 10,000x their rate of time
- This new, nested, simulation then becomes capable of simulating the universe and life as well
- ... and so on

Assuming each simulation is able to solve the memory problem associated with simulating their universe, this chain of simulations can continue near-indefinitely. Now consider this: suppose there are 10,000 levels of simulated worlds, is it more likely that you currently exist in the 1 real world out of the 10,000 or one of the 9,999 simulated worlds?
