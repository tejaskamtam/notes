## Why I Write
Before reading any of my articles, I urge you to review this disclaimer. I want first to explain why I started this blog. It seems arrogant that I force you to understand why you should read my content before posting a single cohesive argument to the public. However, I am plagued daily by the same recurring questions and developments that I am compelled to share, and the time has finally arrived to share. To me, the reality of life is incomprehensibly arbitrary and simultaneously sublime, and I can't live day to day without pondering every belief I come across. I've spent my time absorbing others' teachings and continue to do so (hopefully in perpetuity). Now is the time to share my realization.

I'm unsure if this life is all a simulation or a figment of my imagination. Still, with minimum certainty, I believe this consciousness exists and the identical realization I must ask others to question for themselves. If I can be so bold, I'm too curious for my own good, and I'd like you to experience the same revelations as early as possible to better navigate your life and parse through the blur to what is essential. As far as I know, this is the only life we get, and there's a random timer to how long each of us can continue to passively breeze through existence before questioning its meaning and, more importantly, our purpose.

## Disclaimer
Many of the things that plague my mind day and night are existential in nature - many epiphanies that I've only come to realize have previously been presented by others (we truly do stand on the shoulders of giants). This said, if you are ever at a point where it feels like nothing makes sense or that everything makes too much sense, I plead with you to reach out. Additionally, if you require help, know there is always someone out there who may understand your feelings. Reach out to a professional who can help you parse through your thoughts.

I additionally encourage discussion; I will add a comment section to each of my articles in the hope of finding others who can share the experiences I write about, and may this not suit you, you are always welcome to reach out to me personally. Again, though, I have to reemphasize that if at any point in your life, you feel hopeless, helpless, alone, or in any other way chronically negative, please, please, please reach out to a professional who can adequately help you get through whatever you are going through.

As a primer, I insist you first read the [Preface from Nietzsche's *On the Genealogy of Morals*](http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class%20Readings/Nietzsche/genealogypreface.htm#:~:text=Nietzsche%3A%20Genealogy%20of%20Morals%3A%20Preface&text=We%20don't%20know%20ourselves,find%20out%20who%20we%20are.). I confide heavily in his works, not only in the contents, but I've found that my prose and tone share a semblance to his own – which may provide better context to my substance.

I hope you enjoy. All views are my own.
